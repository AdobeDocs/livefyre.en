# Custom HTML{#custom-html}

Allow moderators, owners, and bloggers to add custom HTML attachments to content published through Comments or Live Blog.

The Custom HTML Embed feature allows moderators, owners and bloggers to add custom HTML attachments to the content they publish through Comments or Live Blog. This feature may be used to attach any content to your posts, including proprietary video players or polling widgets, in addition to the standard images, video players, and other embeds that are automatically expanded by Livefyre Apps.

Work with your Account Manager to enable this feature for your network or site.
