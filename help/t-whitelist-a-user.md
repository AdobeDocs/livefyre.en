# Whitelist a User{#whitelist-a-user}

Whitelist a user to allow them to post directly to Apps without being moderatated.

Whitelisting Users allows them to post directly to your Apps. Content posted by whitelisted users will not pass through Livefyreâ€™s SAFE, profanity, or premoderation filters, and will be automatically approved and added to the App.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL +Add]** for **[!UICONTROL Whitelists]**.
1. A popup will appear that allows you to whitelist the user for the entire network, or for a specific site. (Use the CTR or Command key to select multiple sites.)
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Whitelist]**to complete the process.
