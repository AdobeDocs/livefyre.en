# Accept an Invitation to Create a Studio Account{#accept-an-invitation-to-create-a-studio-account}

When a user is invited to access Livefyre, the user uses the link in the email to create their login and account.

1. Livefyre issues an email invitation to create a Studio account.
1. Existing users click the link to create a new Studio account, which links to their existing Livefyre account. New users create an account that connects to their Studio account and user role permissions.
