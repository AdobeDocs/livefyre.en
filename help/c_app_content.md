The App Content tab in your Library allows you to search and moderate content published across your Apps. The **[!UICONTROL  App Content]** tab enables several search filters with wildcard search, to allow you to more quickly and easily define your search parameters.

Use the App Content tab to:

* Search for Content
* View Content History
* Moderate Content
* Add a Tag
* Feature Content
* Associate Content with Products from the Product Catalog
For more information on how to moderate content using the App Content tab, see [](c_about_moderation/c_moderate_content_using_app_content.md#c_moderate_content_using_app_content).

## Wildcard Search {#section_jvr_ntm_zz}

Livefyre search fields support wildcards, which allow you to add an asterisk ( * ) to words (or word fragments) to catch partial matches.

For example:

* ball returns only ball
* ball* returns ball and balloon
* *ball returns ball and football
* *ball* returns ball and uniball and snowballed

## Search for Content {#section_fw1_mtm_zz}

The App Content panel allows you to narrow your search using several different content filtering options.
![](assets/PublishedState-1024x367.png) Use the **[!UICONTROL  Quick Filters]** pulldown to narrow returned content to **[!UICONTROL  All Content]**, **[!UICONTROL  All Sidenotes]**, **[!UICONTROL  Approved]**, **[!UICONTROL  Approved & Flagged]**, **[!UICONTROL  Pending]**, or **[!UICONTROL  Rights Requests]** status. Then select a **[!UICONTROL  Filter by]** option, and use the checkboxes or input fields available to narrow your search.

Use the pulldown menu to sort the content in the list by **[!UICONTROL  Newest]**, **[!UICONTROL  Oldest]**, **[!UICONTROL  Recently updated]**, **[!UICONTROL  Most flags]** or **[!UICONTROL  Most liked]**.

## Filter by options {#section_aqn_xqm_zz}

Use the **[!UICONTROL  Filter by]** bar to filter by the following options:

## Bozo Content {#section_afl_vqm_zz}

In Apps, **[!UICONTROL  Bozo]** content is displayed only to the author of the content. This allows the user to believe their content has been approved, while hiding it from all other users and moderators.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Social content originating with SocialSync or Streams **[!UICONTROL  cannot]** be set to Bozo. 

You can Bozo content for the following reasons:

* Content identified as Spam by SAFE is automatically set to the Bozo state.
* All content from Banned Users is automatically set to Bozo.
* Content may be marked Bozo from Studio.
* Moderators may Bozo content directly in the stream.

## View Content History {#section_ayz_tqm_zz}

The content panel allows you to review the history of all content listed, including premoderation, spam filtering, post date, and any user flags or notes assigned to the item.

Use the tabs across the bottom of the content panel to view its history.

* **[!UICONTROL  More Info:]** lists all activity on this content, including submission, editing, spam check, state change, and notes. The Livefyre Content ID and the userâ€™s IP address is also displayed in this section.
* **[!UICONTROL  Replies:]** lists a maximum of 6 replies. Click **[!UICONTROL  Show all replies]** to display all replies to the post.
* **[!UICONTROL  Flags &amp; Reports:]** lists all user flags, with the avatar of the user who flagged the content, and any Reports (notes that were added by the user when flagging the content).
* **[!UICONTROL  Add a note:]** allows you to add a note, visible to other Admins or Moderators.
* **[!UICONTROL  Request Rights:]** opens the **[!UICONTROL  New Rights Request]** dialog, from which a Rights Request may be issued.
* **[!UICONTROL  Save as Asset:]**opens the **[!UICONTROL  Advanced Options]** dialog, which allows you to save the selected item to your Asset Library, Publish it to an App, or request reuse rights from its author.

## Add a Tag to Content {#section_xb4_mxr_rdb}

Tagging content allows you to categorize and organize content for easy retrieval and style customization, or mark content as featured.

To add Tags, simply click the plus ( **[!UICONTROL  +]**) icon under content. Enter a new tag, or select from a list of existing tags.
![](assets/PublishedAddTag-1024x338.png) 
## Searching for Images in All Assets {#section_zxf_hsf_wcb}

Once you have added the content to the library, you can search content by smart tags.

In the Library, under All Assets, you can search existing images by clicking on **[!UICONTROL  Show Filters]** and then: 
* Entering text to search in the search field
* Sorting by relevance
* Entering text in the **[!UICONTROL  Tags]** field to search by Smart Tags. The Smart Tags ranking algorithm filters content using a smart tag confidence score, how new the content is, and how many stars a user gave the content.


## Featured Content {#section_emb_kqm_zz}

Select the default **[!UICONTROL  Featured]** tag to mark the content as featured, and highlight it as important to your users. Once tagged, use custom styling options to customize Featured Content in your Apps.

## To Feature or Unfeature Content {#section_ojx_3qm_zz}


* From Studio, click the **[!UICONTROL  +]** sign beside a piece of content, select the **[!UICONTROL  Featured]** tag in the dropdown list, and click **[!UICONTROL  Enter]** to Feature content. The tag will be saved and displayed beside the piece of content.
* To un-feature, click the **[!UICONTROL  x]** on the **[!UICONTROL  Featured]** tag displayed on the piece of content.
* From within a Comments, Live Blog or Reviews App, hover over the content you wish to feature, and click **[!UICONTROL  Feature]**. To unfeature, simply hover over the content, and click **[!UICONTROL  Unfeature]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Due to space constraints, Chat content may only be featured or unfeatured using Studio, and may not be featured from within the App itself.


## Editing Featured Content {#section_pyw_hqm_zz}

Most regular actions on content can be taken on Featured content, with the exception of the following:

* Featured content cannot be flagged.
* Users cannot edit their content after it has been Featured, although they can still delete it if they wish. Moderators can edit Featured content.
