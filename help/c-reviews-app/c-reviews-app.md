# Reviews{#reviews}

Rate and review any piece of content on your website, in real-time.

## Reviews {#c_reviews_app}

Rate and review any piece of content on your website, in real-time.

Reviews allows users to easily rate and review products, services, articles or any piece of content on your website, in real-time.

Each Review posted into a Reviews App consists of a one line Review Title, a Body and a numerical Rating. By including a Title and a Rating, the Reviews App quantifies a user’s opinion, and provides a summary of the user’s experience with that product or service.

The default Reviews App consists of a Collection of Reviews and a Summary Section that displays the Average User Rating and Rating Breakdown for the Collection. Users may read and interact with the Reviews, in real-time.

Allure uses Reviews to invite their users to contribute ratings and opinions on the products they feature. With Reviews, Allure is able to capture valuable and personal user feedback from their audience.
