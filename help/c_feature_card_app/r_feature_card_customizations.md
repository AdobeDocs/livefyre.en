# Feature Card Customizations


<a id="section_uds_gzm_5y"></a>


<!-- r_feature_card_customization.dita -->
Feature Card Apps include only standard customizations: **[!UICONTROL  Theme]**, Brand color, Font family, and Font size.

You can customize Feature Cards using:

* **[!UICONTROL  Style]** and **[!UICONTROL  Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL  App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL  Style]** and **[!UICONTROL  Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL  App Designer]**.
* Integration tools. See App Integrations for more on how to customize Apps using Integration Tools.
* **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button]** You can use the Call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button]** Switch the toggle to on to display the Call-to-action button.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Require rights to display products]** Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a Call-to-action button appears for the content. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the Call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action header text]** The words to display in the header above the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default wording is, "Shop these products:".

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button text]** Customize the text on the Call-to-action button. Default text is, "Buy Now."

    * **[!UICONTROL  Product display options]** Choose whether you want to display the **[!UICONTROL  Photo]** and the **[!UICONTROL  Product name]** with the Call-to-action button. 

    * **[!UICONTROL  Product URL referral tracking]** Switch the toggle to on to track referrals from this App to the associated product page. 

    * **[!UICONTROL  Referral tracking key-value pairs]** Add parameters to further specify the referral tracking from your App content to the associated product page.


* **[!UICONTROL  Product page filter]**
    * **[!UICONTROL  Filter UGC by Product ID]**. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Select Product folders]**. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Show related content]**. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
