# Javascript Events for Media Wall

Livefyre provides JavaScript events to track user activity in your Livefyre Apps. For example, you may wish to update the page when users like or share content to Twitter or Facebook, or when new content is posted.

Here is an example of how to receive the events. Replace ` console.log` with your code to map and send the event to your analytics integration (Dynamic Tag Management, Adobe Analytics JS, Google Analytics, etc.):

```
document.body.addEventListener('insights', function (data) { 
 console.log('Received:', data.detail.type, data); 
});
```
