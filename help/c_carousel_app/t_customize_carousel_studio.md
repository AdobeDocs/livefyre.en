# Customize a Carousel Using Studio

All Apps use **[!UICONTROL  Style]** and **[!UICONTROL  Config]** options in the **[!UICONTROL  App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL  Style]** and **[!UICONTROL  Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL  App Designer]**.

You can customize a Carousel using the following additional options in the App Designer:

* **[!UICONTROL  Max Number of Items]** 

  Sets the number of items to be displayed in the Carousel. Default is 50.

* **[!UICONTROL  Orientation]**

  **[!UICONTROL  Responsive]**. For computer screens only

    * If the content is larger than 600 pixels, displays horizontally
    * If the content is smaller than 600 pixels, displays vertically
    * **Vertical.** For computer screens or mobile devices. In mobile devices, the card shrinks to fit the size of the screen.

* **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button]** You can use the Call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button]** Switch the toggle to on to display the call-to-action button.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Require rights to display products]** Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a call-to-action button appears for the content. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Show call-to-action in tile]**. Choose whether to display the call-to-action button on a tile instead of displaying the call-to-action button only when the site visitor clicks on a card and opens the content in a larger window.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action indication text]** The text to display to prompt the user to click on the card to open the call-to-action modal.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action header text]** The words to display in the header above the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default text is, "Shop these products:".

    * **[!UICONTROL  Call-to-action button text]** The words to display in the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default text is, "Buy Now:".

    * **[!UICONTROL  Product display options]** Choose whether you want to display the **[!UICONTROL  Photo]** and the **[!UICONTROL  Product name]** with the Call-to-action button. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Both the Photo and Product name buttons highlight blue when they are enabled.

    * **[!UICONTROL  Product URL referral tracking]** Switch the toggle to on to track referrals from this App to the associated product page. 

    * **[!UICONTROL  Referral tracking key-value pairs]** Add parameters to further specify the referral tracking from your App content to the associated product page.


* **[!UICONTROL  Embed App in multiple pages]**.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Filter UGC by Product ID]**. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Select Product folders]**. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Show related content]**. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
