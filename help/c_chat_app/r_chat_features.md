# Chat Features


<a id="section_lm4_5zz_ry"></a>

To encourage a rapid and engaging dialog, Chat differs from other Livefyre Apps in the following ways:

* The Comment Editor is pre-populated with the text “Press command+enter to post.”
* Users respond to the Chat as a whole, rather than a specific Comment, therefore there is no Reply button, and no Threading in Comments.
* Users are not offered the option to follow Chats, and the Comment Notifier is disabled.
* Email notifications automatically default to OFF.
* User avatars are smaller than those used with Comments.
* The Like button appears only when hovering over a comment.
* The Likes on a comment appear without avatars, only the number of Likes.
* The stream width can be reduced to 250 pixels.
