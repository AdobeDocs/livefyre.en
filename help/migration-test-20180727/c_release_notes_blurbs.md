## Instagram Business Accounts {#section_ixy_zcs_f2b}

In order to use Instagram
Livefyre uses Instagram personal accounts to:

* Perform an Instagram social search by tags or location
* Create Instagram streams for all fields except By Author
* Manually request rights for assets from Instagram
Livefyre uses Instagram business accounts to:

* Perform an Instagram social search by user (user must be an Instagram business account also).
* Create Instagram streams from a specific Instagram user account (the account must also be a business account).
* Request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow

>[!NOTE]
>
>Livefyre recommends you set up both personal and business Instagram accounts so you can take advantage of the full functionality of Livefyre.

Instagram business accounts use Facebook tokens, which expire. Your Livefyre network notifies you when there are 10 and 5 days left before the tokens expire, so you can refresh them.
