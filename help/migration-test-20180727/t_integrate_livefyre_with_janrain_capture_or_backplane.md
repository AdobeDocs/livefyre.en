# Integrate Livefyre with Janrain Capture or Backplane

Skip this section if you’re not using Janrain Capture.
Customers using Janrain Capture and Backplane can use Livefyre Auth for Single Sign On (SSO), allowing users to immediately engage with your Livefyre Apps when they log in to your site. To benefit from this built-in Capture/Backplane integration, you must make configuration changes to both your Capture app and your Livefyre.js integration.
For more information, see [Janrain’s Backplane documentation](http://developers.janrain.com/how-to/integrations/self-serve-integrations-and-tools/backplane-1-2/).

>1. Set Up Capture.
>1. Add Livefyre Defaults to your Capture App.
