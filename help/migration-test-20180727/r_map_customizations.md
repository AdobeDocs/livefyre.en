# Map Customizations


<a id="section_kff_cbg_sy"></a>

The following options are available from the Map app:

* ** `Cluster number` **
  Sets the color for the numbers listed above each content cluster in the App.

* ** `Show zoom controls` **
  Allows users to control the zoom level of your Map.

* ** `Allow panning` **
  Enables panning for your Map, allowing users to drag and reposition the map.

* ** `Enable content modal` **
  Allows users to click on a piece of content to open it in a popup window.

* ** `Enable clustering` **
  Creates clickable groups of content, scaled to user zoom.

* ** `Embedded height / Embedded width` **
  Allows you to set the pixel size at which the Map will be embedded on your site. (Optional.)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If your web developers have defined a ** `height` ** for your Map on the page, these values will be overridden, and your Map will follow responsive design sizing conventions. If they have not defined a height, these values will be used, and your Map will be placed at a set size (non-responsive design). If these fields are left blank, the value will default to 600px wide by 400px high, and the Map will not be responsive.

* ** `Location` **
  Enter the location around which you wish your map to be centered. Use the slider beneath the preview map to define the zoom.

You can customize the Map app using:

* ** `Style` ** and ** `Config` ** options for all Apps in the ** `App Designer` **. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard ** `Style` ** and ** `Config` ** options for all Apps in the ** `App Designer` **.
* Integration tools. See Map for more on how to customize Apps using Integration Tools.
