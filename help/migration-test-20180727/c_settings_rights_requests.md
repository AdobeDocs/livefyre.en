# Setting: Rights Requests

## Setting: Rights Requests {#concept_qsd_pxy_vcb}On this page:
>## How Requesting Rights Works {#c_how_requesting_rights_works}When you bring user-generated content (UGC) into a Livefyre App, the content includes tacit permission for reuse. You cannot use content from Twitter or Instagram for other purposes without the author’s permission.<!-- c_how_requesting_rights_works.dita --> The following rights statuses are available from Library Assets, App Content, ModQ, and AEM Commerce:

* ** `Granted` **. When the author grants you the right to reuse their content, the status of the asset changes to ** `Granted` **.
* ** `Expired` **. Livefyre monitors the Instagram and Twitter stream for the author’s reply for 14 days. After 14 days, the request expires, the rights request status changes to ** `Expired` **, and you can send a second request or remove the item from your Library.

* ** `Requested` **. Request permission for content from the Library. After you request permission, Livefyre sets the asset status to ** `Requested` **.

* ** `Needs Review` **. If the author replies with a note that does not include your #approvalHashtag, the status of the asset changes to ** `Needs Review` **.
* ** `Request Failed` **. Request failed to be sent (due to expired token, etc.).
* ** `Request Pending` **. Queues the Rights Request so that not too many are sent at one time.
