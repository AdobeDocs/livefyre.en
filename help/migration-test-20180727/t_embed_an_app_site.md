# Embed an App on your Site Using Studio

When an App is published, Livefyre generates and displays an embed code, which may be used to embed the App on any page in your Network. To regenerate the HTML snippet used to embed your App on a page:

>1. From the App Overview screen, click the ** `</> Embed Code` ** button.
>1. From the ** `Embed Code` ** panel that opens, copy and paste the HTML code snippet displayed into your web page.
>   For Apps requiring user authentication, your integration for user auth must be complete and located on the page before adding the embed code.>
