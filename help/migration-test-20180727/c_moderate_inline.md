# Moderate Content from a Stream

Moderators can approve or reject pending comments directly from the stream, using the Library.
To moderate pending content, simply mouse over the ** `Pending` ** button.
The ** `Pending` ** button changes and you can select whether to Deny ( ** `x` **) or Approve ( ** `✓` **) the comment.
Mouse over the comment space and the following moderation options display:

* ** `Ban user:` ** bans the user from adding content to the site.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This option is site-specific, and will not ban the user from your entire network. For Sidenotes, users may be banned only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.

* ** `Bozo:` ** Bozos the content’s author. For Sidenotes, users may be Bozo’d only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.
* ** `Delete:` ** Deletes the content from the thread.
* ** `Flag:` ** Opens a Flag modal, allowing you to select a flag for the content (Spam, Offensive, Disagree, or Off-Topic), enter an email address to associate with the Flag, if desired, and add a note.
* ** `Share:` ** Opens a Share modal, which allows you to share to Facebook or Twitter, edit the text, and include a permalink to the content itself.
* ** `Feature:` ** Features the content.
