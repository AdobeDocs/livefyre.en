# Using Reviews

Reviews offers an intuitive user experience, which includes many standard Livefyre features. This page describes end user features specific to the Reviews App.

## Rating Helpfulness {#section_ozq_xlh_21b}

Logged in users may decide if they found another user’s Review helpful or not by clicking on Yes or No. Clicking ** `Yes` ** will increase the overall helpfulness ratio of a review (“1 of 2 found this helpful” will change to “2 of 3 found this helpful”) and clicking ** `No` ** will decrease the overall helpfulness ratio (“1 of 2 found this helpful” will change to “1 of 3 found this helpful”).

## Sort Options {#section_tvb_1mh_21b}

Reviews may be sorted by the following options:

* Most helpful (default)
* Highest rated
* Lowest rated
* Newest
* Oldest

## Review Queue {#section_yr2_bmh_21b}

When a new review is posted while a user is on the page, it will be queued at the top of the stream. Clicking on the New Reviews image will add all new reviews to the top of the stream, regardless of sort order. Refreshing the page will reorder the reviews according to the currently selected sort order.
Users writing reviews will always see their post immediately upon Save, and all moderation state changes will be updated and visible in real-time for all sort orders.

## Social Sharing {#section_lzf_cmh_21b}

Reviews may be shared on social networks.
