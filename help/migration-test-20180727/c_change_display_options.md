Available for Chat, Comments, Live Blog, Reviews, and Sidenotes.
Livefyre offers several options by which your Appâ€™s display may be customized to fit your branding and style, including CSS classes, localized text strings, and App element and media restrictions. Options may be defined for Comments, Live Blog, Reviews, Sidenotes, the Comment Notifier, archived comments, and pre-defined user groups.

* Specify the Date/Time Format to conform to your style.
* Move the Livefyre Logo to display it less conspicuously on your App.
