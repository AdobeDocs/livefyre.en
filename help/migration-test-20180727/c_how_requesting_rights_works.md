# Requesting Rights

The following rights statuses are available from the Library, App Content, ModQ, and AEM Commerce:

* ** `Granted` **. When the author grants you the right to reuse their content, the status of the asset changes to ** `Granted` **.
* ** `Expired` **. Livefyre monitors the Instagram and Twitter stream for the authorâ€™s reply for 14 days. After 14 days, the request expires, the rights request status changes to ** `Expired` **, and you can send a second request or remove the item from your Library.

* ** `Requested` **. Request permission for content from the Library. You can do this for one or more assets at a time. After you request permission, Livefyre sets the asset status to ** `Requested` **.

* ** `Needs Review` **. If the author replies with a note that does not include your #approvalHashtag, the status of the asset changes to ** `Needs Review` **.
* ** `Request Failed` **. Request failed to be sent (due to expired token, etc.).
* ** `Request Pending` **. Queues the Rights Request so that not too many are sent at one time.
You can request rights for assets you obtained from Twitter and Instagram. You must save the asset to the Library to request rights.
Requesting rights from Instagram works two different ways, depending on whether you have a business or personal account configured.

* You must configure an *Instagram personal account* in order to manually request rights for assets from Instagram.

* You must configure an *Instagram business account*to request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow.
