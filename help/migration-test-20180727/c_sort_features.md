## Sort by Helpfulness {#section_grr_hfs_d1b}

## Sort by Newest to Oldest, First to Last {#section_t4s_hfs_d1b}

For the Comments App, you can choose to allow users to sort from the most recently published content to least recently published content.
In Storify 2, site visitors can sort from the first post to the last post or from the last post to the first post. Storify 2 posts appear in the order a moderator decides, not based on published time.

## Top Comments {#section_cft_hfs_d1b}

Top Comments lists the 25 most liked comments in the conversation. The ** `Top Comments` ** view displays the 25 most liked comments in the Collection. If an original post receives the most likes, the post, but not its replies, will be listed. If a reply receives the most likes, its immediate parent, up to the top level post, will also be displayed. This list is not real-time, and will update only when the page is refreshed or another sort view ( ** `Newest` ** or ** `Oldest` **) is selected.
If a user posts a comment from the comment editor while viewing the ** `Top Comments` ** view, the user will be switched back to the ** `Newest` ** view. If a user likes or replies to one of the Top Comments, it will stream into the ** `Top Comments` ** view for the user to see.
To optimize for performance, Livefyre caches data for up to 2 minutes. There may be a slight lag in the most recent likes that appear.
If there are no comments in the Collection with likes, users will see the message ** `There are not enough likes yet` **, and a link to ** `See whatâ€™s new` **.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Top Comments and Hot Threads may not be included in the same Collection.

For information on enabling the Top Comments view, please see ** `Studio > Network Settings` **.
