<!-- c_socialsync.dita --> With SocialSync, the conversation on Facebook and Twitter is synced directly back to properties you own and operate. When links to your blog posts and articles are shared on Twitter and Facebook, the replies made on those social networks will be pulled directly into the Collection on your web page in real-time. SocialSync is available only for Comments.
When users reply to your post on Facebook or Twitter, the social media content will be seamlessly streamed into your Collection in real-time. Users can interact with social media content locally from your page, allowing Retweets, replies, and following/subscribing within the Collection, for seamless user interactions across social media platforms, increasing time on-site by enabling social conversation directly, rather than across multiple sites.
Enable SocialSync through Studio.

* Facebook SocialSync may be enabled at both the network and site levels. Facebook Pages should be specified at the site level to pull content into a specific site.
* Twitter SocialSync may be enabled only at the site level. There is no network level setting for Twitter SocialSync.

## SocialSync display {#section_t14_kbf_wy}

Content from SocialSync may be identified by small Facebook or Twitter icons next to the content in the App.

## Moderating SocialSync comments {#section_c31_jbf_wy}

All content pulled into your page though SocialSync is passed through the Spam and Profanity filters before hitting your page.
Network and Site Owners and Moderators may also moderate, delete, and filter SocialSync content through the Content panel in Studio.

## Facebook SocialSync {#section_dkz_gbf_wy}

To enable SocialSync for Facebook, your Facebook page (and any Facebook pages from which you hope to pull content) must have the following Facebook App settings enabled:

* ** `Privacy Settings > Who can see my stuff > Who can see your future posts > Public` **
* ** `Followers Settings > Who can follow me > Everybody` **
If these settings are not enabled for the Facebook page, SocialSync will be unable to pull content into your Livefyre App.
SocialSync for Facebook allows you to import content from multiple Facebook Pages.
To enable Facebook SocialSync, click ** `+ Rule` **. Under ** `Site Rules` **, enter the customized URL as it appears for the Facebook Page. For example, for https://www.facebook.com/Livefyre, enter Livefyre in the username field. Click the check mark to save the Rule.

The frequency with which Facebook content is included in Apps is adaptive, based on the Facebook Page and post traffic patterns. Facebook content from Pages, and posts with active content will be pulled more frequently than less active Facebook pages.

>[!NOTE]
>
>There will be a short delay for the Facebook replies posted back to the article page. When activating SocialSync, content from Facebook will be synced to your page retroactively, up to 150 posts per Facebook Page and 5000 posts. This delay may be 24 hours or more, depending on the activity level for the stream.


## Notes: {#section_f2y_fbf_wy}


* On your Facebook Page, post a link to your Page status update. For best results, post the full URL to the article, but Bitly and other URL shorteners will work. Make sure that the clicked link leads to your blog post or article URL, and not a page inside an iFrame.
* To increase engagement, ask a question when you post the blog post or article URL to your Fan Page to elicit responses from your community.
* When people reply to the post on your Fan page, continue the conversation on your Fan Page and tag others that you would like to join the conversation to keep the dialog going.
