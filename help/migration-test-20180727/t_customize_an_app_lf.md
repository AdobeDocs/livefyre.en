# Customize an App

** ` Style` ** options are consistent across all App types; ** ` Configuration` ** options vary by App. The bottom of the Style and Configuration pane lists the Livefyre App version for your App. If a newer version of the codebase for the App exists, an ** ` Update` **button will also be displayed. Click the button to update to the newest release version, and refresh your App with all available feature enhancements and bug fixes. Once updated, preview changes made to your App (if any), then accept or reject the update.
**Select Style Options**
Apps may be styled to fit your site’s branding. Use the ** ` Style` ** options to select the App’s color and font styles.

* ** ` Theme` **. Select ** ` Light` ** or ** ` Dark` ** to define the background color for your displayed content. Changes made to this setting will be immediately reflected in the preview to the right. This setting controls background, content text, user handle, timestamp, share button, and social icon color selection for the App.
* ** ` Brand color` **. Select a color for your App. This color will be used for hashtags, URLs, usernames, @mentions, bar charts, and other App-specific components, as displayed in the preview pane to the right.
* ** ` Font family` **. Select a font for user generated content in your App. Selecting Georgia or Times New Roman will assign that font to content, and Helvetica Neue to usernames and display names. Selecting Helvetica, Verdana, or Trebuchet will assign those fonts to content, usernames, and display names.
* ** ` Font size` **. Select a default font size. This setting will affect all user generated content and titles displayed in the App.
