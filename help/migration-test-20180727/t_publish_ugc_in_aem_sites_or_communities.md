# Publish UGC in AEM Sites or Communities

You can use UGC in AEM Sites or Communities in one of two ways:

* To use the content with the Social Media information it came from (for example, to make a piece of Twitter content come with the data from Twitter as well as the Twitter logo), the content must be inside a Livefyre component on an AEM Site.
    * Note: Any UGC content published to a Livefyre component happens in real time and does not go through the AEM publish workflow.

* To use the content as media only (for example, to use a photo by itself on your site with no information about where it came from, like Twitter or Instagram), use the asset in an image component on an AEM Site. Video or text-only content is not supported outside of the UGC context.
