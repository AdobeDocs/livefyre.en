# Preview an App

Click ** `Preview Mode` ** to select mobile, tablet, or desktop format, and whether or not to display ** `Sample Data` **. Click ** `Preview Mode` ** to expand the preview to fill the Studio window. Click ** `Exit Preview` ** to return to design mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If ** `Sample Data` ** is deselected, and no Stream enabled for the App, nothing will be displayed in Preview Mode.

Preview Mode offers the following options:

* ** `Preview Options` **: Use the pulldown menu to select a preview format (mobile, tablet, or desktop), and whether to show ** `Sample Data` ** or the App’s Stream data.
* ** `Share` **: Opens the App in a new browser tab, and generates a URL, which may be used to allow friends, colleagues, or non-Studio users to review your App, and test it in different browsers and devices.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Any content posted to a review version of your App will be added to the App. If you do not wish this content to appear in your published App, you must delete it before clicking**Publish**.

* ** `Exit Preview:` ** Returns you to edit mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview mode is fully interactive, allowing you to test the user experience for your App. If ** `Allow user posts` ** is enabled for your App, users with whom you have shared the preview link may click the ** `What’s on your mind` ** button, and post content to your test version. Content will be listed as posted by Studio.
