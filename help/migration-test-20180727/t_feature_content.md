# Feature Content

Featuring content allows you to call attention to selected user posts. Featured content may be styled differently than other content on the page, and featured Livefyre-native content appears above the editor. Once featured, content includes a Featured badge, and may be custom styled using the fyre-featured CSS class. The two most recently featured Livefyre-native content items will also be displayed above the editor in the stream.
