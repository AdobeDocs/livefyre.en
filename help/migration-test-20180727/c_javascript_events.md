# JavaScript Events Definitions and Examples

Livefyre provides JavaScript events to track user activity in your Livefyre Apps. For example, you may wish to update the page when users like or share content to Twitter or Facebook, or when new content is posted.
Livefyre also allows you to add events to third-party analytics integrations (Adobe Analytics JS, Google Analytics, Dynamic Tag Management, etc.), to track App events. For more information, work with your third-party integration manager to supply the correct events.
To bind to these events, add the following code to the page when instantiating your App on a page. Substitute the event name for ` {eventName}`:

```
Livefyre.require(['fyre.conv#3'], function(Conv) { 
   new Conv(networkConfig, [convConfig], function(widget) { 
      widget.on('{eventName}', function (data) { 
         // Do something, perhaps using data 
      }); 
   }); 
});
```

>[!NOTE]

>Data objects are provided for all event handlers. Example data objects follow each event.
