# Send Instagram Rights Request

Before you can send a rights request you must:

* Add an Instagram social account. For more information on how to configure a social account, see [](t_configure_social_accout_instagram.md#t_configure_social_accout_instagram). To send a manual Instagram rights request, you must set up an Instagram personal account. To send a partially-automated rights request, you must set up an Instagram business account. For more information about Instagram accounts, see [](c_about_instagram_accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts)
* Set up Rights Management. For more information on how to set up rights management, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
To send a rights request for Instagram content:

1. Open the ** `Rights options` ** window.
1. Select the account to use to request rights. The account must be an Instagram business account.
1. (Optional) Edit the request message. If the message is missing an element or a required element is misspelled, an error message displays that specifies the incorrect or missing information.
1. Click ** `Copy` ** to copy the text in the box to your clipboard. ![](images/rr_insta_workaround1.png)
   Livefyre automatically copies the text from the box to the clipboard and displays a message confirming that you have copied the text.

1. Click on the link in the confirmation message to open the post that contains the asset to which you are requesting rights. ![](images/rr_insta_workaround2.png)
   Livefyre opens the post in Instagram.

1. Paste the copied rights request text into the Instagram post on Instagram.
If you have an Instagram business account set up, Livefyre will monitor the request and automatically update the asset with rights granted when the Instagram user approves the rights request. Livefyre tracks this automatic monitoring and update in the Rights Activity History.
If you have an Instagram personal account set up, but not an Instagram business account, follow this process to manually monitor the rights request:

1. To find out if the user responded, manually monitor the post in Instagram for the response.
1. When the Instagram user grants rights, you can manually grant the rights to the piece of content in Livefyre. For information on how to manually grant rights in Livefyre, see [](t_manually_grant_the_rights_for_one_or_more_assets.md#t_manually_grant_the_rights_for_one_or_more_assets).
Livefyre tracks when you manually request rights for an asset and grant rights for an asset. Livefyre does not automatically track rights requests for Instagram personal accounts.
