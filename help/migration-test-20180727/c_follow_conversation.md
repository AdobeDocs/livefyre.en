# Follow Conversation

Following a conversation allows users to receive email notifications, based on activity in the conversation. Users click the ** `Follow` ** / ** `Unfollow` ** button to set conversation-specific preferences, or use their ** `Profile Settings` ** page to set a site-wide preference to follow conversations.
(The ** `Follow` ** function is not available on mobile.)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Emails will only be sent for manually posted content, not for content pulled into the stream through SocialSync or Curate.
