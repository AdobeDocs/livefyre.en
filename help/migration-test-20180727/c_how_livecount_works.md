# Livecount

Listener Count is the number of site visitors that have a browser open to the page on which an App is instantiated. This allows you to know how many site visitors are on the page at any given time, so you can track them while they watch streaming or live content in real time.
Livefyre's live count works like this:

1. The site containing your App pings a Livefyre server every 60 seconds.
1. The Livefyre server responds with the number of site visitors on the page that displays the App (defined as the number of site visitors with a browser open to that page).
1. The number of site visitors on the page with the App displays on the App.
