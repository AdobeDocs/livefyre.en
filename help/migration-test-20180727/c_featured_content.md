# Featured Content

Any piece of content in a Collection can be tagged as “featured” by your network site owners or moderators, in order to highlight important content and encourage high quality replies from other users. Once a piece of content has been featured, a ** `Featured` ** tag will be displayed on the content in the app, so that users can easily identify content that owners and moderators have highlighted.
In Comments:

* The two most recent pieces of ** `Featured` ** content will also be pulled above the stream.
* It may take up to seven minutes for Featured content to appear above the editor.
* A ** `Featured` ** tag may be added to any comment within the stream, and used to style the comment, but only Livefyre-native user generated content will appear above the editor.
When content is unfeatured, the ** `Featured` ** tag displayed will be removed in real-time.
Once a piece of content has been featured, a ** `Featured` ** badge will be displayed on the content in the app, and you may use the fyre-featured CSS class to custom style the content.
