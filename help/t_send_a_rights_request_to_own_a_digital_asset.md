# Send a Twitter Rights Request

Before you can send a rights request you must:
* Add a Twitter social account. For more information on how to configure a social account, see [](t_configure_social_accout_instagram/t_configure_social_accout_instagram.md#t_configure_social_accout_instagram).
* Set up Rights Management. For more information on how to set up rights management, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
You can send rights requests from the Library, App Content, or the ModQ. In the Library and in App Content, you must save a Twitter asset before you can request rights for that asset. Click on the details for an asset to request rights.

For ModQ, you can request rights by clicking **[!UICONTROL  More Details]** on a Twitter asset.

>1. Open the **[!UICONTROL  Rights options]** window.
>1. Select the account to use to request rights.
>1. (Optional) Edit the request message. If the message is missing an element or a required element is misspelled, an error message displays that specifies the incorrect or missing information.
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Send]** to send the request to the owner of the content.
