# Smart Tags

Livefyre uses Adobe Sensei image-recognition technology to automatically tag images you save or upload in the library.

With Smart Tags you can save a significant amount of time searching and moderating content. With Smart Tags, you can:

* Search saved and uploaded images for precise content based on the image content, rather than only text 
* Collect content in streams based on precise search terms that analyze the image, rather than only text

When you save or upload an image, Adobe Sensei automatically reviews the image and tags it with 135,000 classifiers across three categories:

* Features (for example, cats, dogs, pyramids, landmarks) 
* Categories (for example, travel, tourism, beauty) 
* Aesthetic properties (for example, picture quality, rules of third) 
* SFW/NSFW (this allows you to automatically filter NSFW images, improving the safety of your streams and UGC library

The Smart Tags ranking algorithm filters content using a smart tag confidence score, how new the content is, and how many stars a user gave the content.

For additional Information on Smart Tags, see [](c_stream_rule_options_for_all_stream_rules.md#c_stream_rule_options_for_all_stream_rules).
