Embed real-time comments into your App.

Comments replaces your default comments with real-time conversations. Our social integration features make it easy to capture all the conversations going on about your posts across Twitter and Facebook, and pull userâ€™s friends into the conversation.

Mashable uses Comments to increase user participation in their discussions. Features including rich media upload, social sharing, listener count and single sign-on help to make contributing to the conversation easy and fun.
