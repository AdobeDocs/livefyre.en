                    the top of the page to tag the folder, and add it to your
                        <uicontrol>Favorites</uicontrol> list.</li>
                <li><uicontrol>Upload Asset:</uicontrol> Opens a Filepicker window, from which you

                    within the currently selected folder. Subfolders inherit the Access rights of

                        network to access the folder and its content. Select
                            <uicontrol>Restricted</uicontrol> to restrict access to a select group
                        of users.</p>
