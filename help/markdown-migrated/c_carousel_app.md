Carousel is a Livefyre App that allows you to showcase your best content in a horizontal, scrollable view. Use this App on pages with limited real estate, inviting people to experience each piece of curated content individually, in real time. A Carousel allows users to browse content, then click to select an item, and open it within a popup modal.

For a less distracting viewing experience, a Carousel displays the latest content and keeps the current view until the user reloads the next set of items.

A Carousel displays Livefyre and streamed content as a horizontal slideshow. A Carousel allows users to browse content, then click to select an item, and open it within a popup modal.

For an optimal viewing experience, a Carousel displays the latest content and keeps the current view until the user refreshes the page.

## How does a site visitor see content in a Carousel? Can I stream content into a
          Carousel? {#section_jvs_mnt_wy}

A site visitor sees content populated into a Carousel from Studio from a Studio Stream or Social Search. If new content is published to the App while a site visitor is on the page, the site visitor must refresh the page to see the updated content. New published content appears in the App after up to 5 minutes.

## How many characters will a Carousel display for each card? {#section_qsx_xrt_wy}

A Carousel dynamically recalculates the number of characters to display depending on the screen or container size. If there are more characters than the Carousel can display, then an ellipsis (“…”) ends the displayed text.

## What does a URL look like for a card in a Carousel? {#section_hnh_wrt_wy}

If a URL exists, the URL is highlighted in a bar when you click on the content. If there is more than one URL, the card highlights only one URL. Any additional URLs are truncated by an ellipsis (“…”).

## How does a Carousel look on different platforms? {#section_hpc_5rt_wy}

You can choose the mode you want to use:

* Desktop responsive mode
    * If the content is larger than 600 pixels, displays horizontally
    * If the content is smaller than 600 pixels, displays vertically
  
* Desktop vertical mode: Always vertical, shrinks as the container gets smaller
* Mobile: Always vertical, shrinks to fit the size of the screen
## What happens when a site visitor clicks on an item in a Carousel? {#section_xn3_2xm_wy}

A site visitor can:

* Click on an image to display a larger image.
* Click on a video to watch it.
* Click on content with multiple items to scroll through the items.
## What does featuring content do to items in a Carousel? {#section_tdp_cxm_wy}

Content with a “Featured” tag appears in front. If you feature more than one content item, each item will appear in the front of the app in order of the content published date.

## What else should I know about how a Carousel looks on a website? {#section_r3q_bxm_wy}

Content count: Content count stays at the bottom of the Carousel and increases or decreases as a user scrolls.

Wrap-around: A Carousel wraps around from the last item to the first item. If there are fewer than six items in the Carousel, the Carousel stops at the sixth post and does not rotate back to the first post.

## Can I add an Upload Button to a Carousel? {#section_ozs_1xm_wy}

You can add an Upload Button to a Carousel. If you publish the Upload Button to the App while a site visitor is on the page, the site visitor must refresh the page to see the updated content. The Upload Button will appear in the App after up to 5 minutes.
