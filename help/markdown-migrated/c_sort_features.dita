   <p>For the Comments App, you can choose to allow users to sort from the most recently published
    content to least recently published content. </p>
   <p>In Storify 2, site visitors can sort from the first post to the last post or from the last
    post to the first post. Storify 2 posts appear in the order a moderator decides, not based on
    published time.</p>

   <title>Top Comments</title>
   <p>Top Comments lists the 25 most liked comments in the conversation. The <uicontrol>Top
     Comments</uicontrol> view displays the 25 most liked comments in the Collection. If an original
    post receives the most likes, the post, but not its replies, will be listed. If a reply receives
    the most likes, its immediate parent, up to the top level post, will also be displayed. This
    list is not real-time, and will update only when the page is refreshed or another sort view
     (<uicontrol>Newest</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Oldest</uicontrol>) is selected.</p>
   <p>If a user posts a comment from the comment editor while viewing the <uicontrol>Top
     Comments</uicontrol> view, the user will be switched back to the <uicontrol>Newest</uicontrol>
    view. If a user likes or replies to one of the Top Comments, it will stream into the
     <uicontrol>Top Comments</uicontrol> view for the user to see.</p>
   <p>To optimize for performance, Livefyre caches data for up to 2 minutes. There may be a slight
    lag in the most recent likes that appear.</p>
   <p>If there are no comments in the Collection with likes, users will see the message
     <uicontrol>There are not enough likes yet</uicontrol>, and a link to <uicontrol>See whatâ€™s
     new</uicontrol>.</p>
   <note>Top Comments and Hot Threads may not be included in the same Collection.</note>
   <p>For information on enabling the Top Comments view, please see <uicontrol>Studio > Network
     Settings</uicontrol>.</p>
