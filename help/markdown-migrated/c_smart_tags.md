# Smart Tags

Livefyre uses Adobe Sensei image-recognition technology to automatically tag images you save in the library.

With Smart Tags you can save a significant amount of time searching and moderating content. With Smart Tags, you can:

* Search saved images for precise content based on the image content, rather than only text
* Collect content in streams based on precise search terms that analyze the image, rather than only text
When you save an image, Adobe Sensei automatically reviews the image and tags it with 135,000 classifiers across three categories:

  *
  Features (for example, cats, dogs, pyramids, landmarks)
  
  
  *
  Categories (for example, travel, tourism, beauty)
  
  
  *
  Aesthetic properties (for example, picture quality, rules of third)
  
  
The Smart Tags ranking algorithm filters content using a smart tag confidence score, how new the content is, and how many stars a user gave the content.
