## Streaming Real Time {#section_emd_syl_d1b}

Livefyre Apps stream content in real-time when content is published manually from Studio or from a content stream. this means that newly published content will appear in the app without the end user needing to refresh the app page.

* [ Chat ](c_chat_app.md#c_chat_app)

* [ Trending ](c_trending_app.md#c_trending_app)

* [ Mosaic ](c_mosaic_app.md#c_mosaic_app)
## Queue Comments {#section_p21_bbm_d1b}

Stop live streaming and queue content at the top of the stream to control high velocity conversations.

Use Queue Comments to provide a better user experience with high velocity conversations. Designed to encourage thoughtful reading, rather than a real-time experience of posted comments, this feature queues new comments at the top of the stream, and displays a counter of the number of new posts, rather than the posts themselves. Clicking on this number streams the oldest 10 comments into the conversation. Clicking again will stream the next 10. As new replies are posted, they are added to the queue.

The Queue comments feature is available for Comments, and may be set at the network, site or conversation levels, from Studio’s Settings tab.

Apps that use this feature:

* [ Chat ](c_chat_app.md#c_chat_app)
* [ Comments ](c_comments_app.md#c_comments_app)
## Throttle Content {#section_d5c_2bm_d1b}

Throttle content using intelligent rules to control high velocity conversations.

Use Throttle Content to control high velocity chats, when the real time nature of the content is important. When enabled, Throttle Content throttles high velocity content streams, and displays only content that the system deems most “intelligent.”

When this feature is enabled:

* Users see their own content stream into the page, because is will be deemed “intelligent content” for that user.
* Users can view all previous content upon page load or refresh.
* Moderators will not experience a throttled stream; they see all content stream in.
* Because Moderator-generated content is deemed intelligent, it will always stream into the Collection for all users.
If the velocity drops, Livefyre will display all content, streaming in real-time.

This feature may be enabled at the Collection level using Collection Settings in Studio. You may not Throttle Content at the network or site level.

Apps that use this feature:

* [ Chat ](c_chat_app.md#c_chat_app)
* [ Comments ](c_comments_app.md#c_comments_app)

>## Photo Upload {#c_photo_upload}
>Upload images to a Live Blog, Chat, Reviews, or Comments stream.

This photo upload feature can be used in conjunction with the “Premoderate Media” setting.

>Allow users to post, edit, flag, delete, reply to and like content in your Collections, with a full range of rich text formatting options.

<!-- c_user_posts.dita -->
Livefyre Apps allow your users to post and interact with content seamlessly and intuitively. The Livefyre interface provides rich text and image input, the ability to Like, Flag, or Reply to others’ comments, as well as the ability to edit or delete your own, previous posts.

## Post {#section_bty_ww2_wy}

Users may post content when logged in by entering a comment or media link in the editor box and clicking `uicontrol  Post comment`.

To post content when not logged in, users enter a comment or media link in the editor, and click `uicontrol  Post comment as…`. The login window will appear to prompt a login.

(Most browsers allow 8,000 character comments; Internet Explorer allows 1,500 characters.)

## Rich Text Formatting {#section_mg1_sw2_wy}

Users may style comments using rich text formatting, including bold, italics, underline, and numbered and bulleted lists.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Rich text formatting is not available on mobile.
## Reply {#section_ubz_pw2_wy}

Users may reply to any comment in a thread by clicking the Reply link for that comment.

For Chat and Live Blog, replies may be enabled or disabled using the Collection’s settings within Studio.

## Like {#section_its_kw2_wy}

Users must be logged in to like another user’s content, and may not like their own content.

The number of likes and up to four user avatars are displayed next to the `uicontrol  Like` button.

When liking content, the `uicontrol  Like` link will change to `uicontrol  Unlike`. Clicking `uicontrol  Unlike` will remove the avatar for that user and decrease the number by 1.

## Edit {#section_ubt_qwx_vy}

By default, users can edit their own content within 5 minutes of posting, by clicking the `uicontrol  Edit` link to open an Edit text box.

You may disable this feature at the Collection level using the Settings panel of Studio. The Settings panel may also be used to change the time during which comments may be edited at the network level.

Moderators may edit user content at any time, both inline in the stream and from the Content panel.

## Delete {#section_gbr_pwx_vy}

Users may delete their own content at any time by clicking `uicontrol  Delete` (displayed when hovering over the content). Moderators may click `uicontrol  Delete` to remove any user’s content. ( `uicontrol  Delete` is not available on mobile.)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When a user deletes their own content, it is removed from your network and is no longer displayed in Studio.
## Flag {#section_j3l_qvx_vy}

Users may Flag another user’s content by clicking the `uicontrol  Flag` link displayed when hovering over the content.

Clicking this link will display the Flag modal, allowing users to flag the content as `uicontrol  Offensive`, `uicontrol  Disagree`, `uicontrol  Off Topic`, or `uicontrol  Spam`. An optional Note and email address may be added with the flag.

Users do not need to be signed in to flag a comment, allowing anyone to flag a comment for moderation, without having to create an account.

To discourage other users from simply flagging flagged content, flagging a comment does not change its display. Flags are visible only to moderators, who may use Studio to search and view by flag. Moderators may also enable emails to notify them immediately when a comment is flagged in moderated conversations.

If a moderator flags a comment as Spam, the comment will immediately be set to the Bozo state and removed from the stream. The Spam Filter will be updated and improved for your network, based on this action.

You may also create Moderation Rules, to automate the actions taken on flagged comments.

## Sort {#section_bpg_nwx_vy}

Streamed content may be sorted by age, newest first (default) or oldest first, by clicking the `uicontrol  Newest` or `uicontrol  Oldest` links at the top of the stream.

## Collapse/Expand {#section_ypt_qr4_h1b}

  *
  `uicontrol  Collapse Replies`
  
  Replies may be expanded or collapsed in the stream by clicking the **+ / -** buttons above the replies.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol  Collapsed View`
