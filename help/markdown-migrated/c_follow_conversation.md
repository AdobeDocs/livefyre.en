# Follow Conversation

Following a conversation allows users to receive email notifications, based on activity in the conversation. Users click the `uicontrol Follow` / `uicontrol Unfollow` button to set conversation-specific preferences, or use their `uicontrol Profile Settings` page to set a site-wide preference to follow conversations.

(The `uicontrol Follow` function is not available on mobile.)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Emails will only be sent for manually posted content, not for content pulled into the stream through SocialSync or Curate.
