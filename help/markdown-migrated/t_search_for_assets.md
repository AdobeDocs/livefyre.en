# Search Saved Assets in the Library

The following options are available in the Library to assist you in finding assets.

* `uicontrol Folder View:` When a folder is selected for view, use this option to define whether to display the folderâ€™s contents only, or the contents of the folder and all its subfolders.
* `uicontrol Contains:` select the content type you wish to be returned: `uicontrol Photo` or `uicontrol Video`.
* `uicontrol Rights:` select the rights request status to filter by rights request status.
* `uicontrol Source:` select the source from which content should be listed. `uicontrol Uploaded` lists any assets added from your local machine, Flickr, Dropbox, or any of the other available Filepicker options. `uicontrol Livefyre` lists user generated content posted directly into the stream.
* `uicontrol Sort By:` use these options to sort returned content by `uicontrol Date Added` (to your Library), `uicontrol Date Created`, or `uicontrol Relevance`.
* `uicontrol Stars:` select the number of stars that must be added to the Asset for it to be returned.
