SocialSync for Facebook allows you to import content from multiple Facebook Pages.

To enable Facebook SocialSync, click `uicontrol + Rule`. Under `uicontrol Site Rules`, enter the customized URL as it appears for the Facebook Page. For example, for https://www.facebook.com/Livefyre, enter Livefyre in the username field. Click the check mark to save the Rule.

The frequency with which Facebook content is included in Apps is adaptive, based on the Facebook Page and post traffic patterns. Facebook content from Pages, and posts with active content will be pulled more frequently than less active Facebook pages.

>There will be a short delay for the Facebook replies posted back to the article page. When activating SocialSync, content from Facebook will be synced to your page retroactively, up to 150 posts per Facebook Page and 5000 posts. This delay may be 24 hours or more, depending on the activity level for the stream.
