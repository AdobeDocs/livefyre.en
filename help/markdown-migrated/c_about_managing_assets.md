# About Managing Assets

Click to select the content you wish to manage, then use the buttons to:

* `uicontrol  Add to folder:` allows you to add the selected content to a selected folder.
* `uicontrol  Publish` (to an App): pushes the selected Asset directly to the selected App.
* (Add) `uicontrol  Tags:` use the input field to add (searchable) tags to content.
* (Add) `uicontrol  Stars:` add stars to enable your owners and moderators to filter content. Assigned stars will not be visible to your end users.
  *
  `uicontrol  Trash:` click to remove the item from your folder.
  
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Trash is location dependent. Clicking`uicontrol  Trash` from within a folder view will remove the item from that folder only; clicking `uicontrol  Trash` from the `uicontrol  All Assets`view removes the item from all applicable folders within your Library. Clicking `uicontrol  Trash` for an item will not remove it from any Apps in which it is already included.
  
You can mouse over a piece of content, then select `uicontrol  View Details:` to open the item in a new page, listing author and post information.

Use the `uicontrol  …` menu to select `uicontrol  More actions`:

* `uicontrol  Add to folder:` allows you to select a folder to which the item will be added.
* `uicontrol  Request Rights:` allows you to generate a request to the item’s author, requesting the right to reuse their content for your commercial purposes.
* `uicontrol  Publish:` allows you to select the (existing) App to which the item should be published.
* `uicontrol  Tag:` allows you to add tags to the Asset.
* `uicontrol  Stars:` allows you to add stars to the Asset.
* `uicontrol  Trash:` opens a dialog which allows you to delete the item from the selected folder, or from all folders.
Click `uicontrol  View Details` to open an Asset Details page for the item. This page includes information listed for the Details page from the Social Search tab, as well as any tags, stars, or rights request information you may have added to the item through Studio.
