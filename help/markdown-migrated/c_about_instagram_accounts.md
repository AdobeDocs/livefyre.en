# About Instagram Accounts

Instagram requires the following in order to use Instagram with Livefyre:
* Business accounts for users and the accounts of any users from which you want to directly stream content
* Refreshing tokens regularly to ensure that the accounts are being used and active

Instagram tokens can expire, often with little or no warning.

When a token expires, Livefyre notifies you in the following ways:
* When you search for Instagram content, a window displays in the lower left side stating that your Instagram token is expired. If you set up other Instagram accounts, Livefyre automatically searches Instagram using the next Instagram account in your list.
* When you request rights with a specific, expired Instagram account, an error displays, and you must select another Instagram account or refresh the token for the expired account and click on request rights again.
* Streams using an expired Instagram account will not function.
* The Instagram account in `uicontrol Network Settings` &gt; `uicontrol Social Accounts` displays an error warning icon (![](images/warningError.png)).

You can refresh your token by clicking Refresh Token next to the account in `uicontrol Network Settings` &gt; `uicontrol Social Accounts` &gt; `uicontrol Instagram Accounts`.
