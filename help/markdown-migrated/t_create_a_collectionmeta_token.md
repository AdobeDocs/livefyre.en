# Create a Collection Using the CollectionMeta Token

>1. Create the collectionMeta token.
>   
>1. Create the checksum.
>   The checksum is required if you wish to notify Livefyre of any changes that youâ€™ve made to your Collection. Livefyre will update your Collection only if the checksum provided is different than the previously sent checksum. Creating a checksum is just like creating a collectionMeta token but instead of calling buildCollectionMetaToken you call buildChecksum.
