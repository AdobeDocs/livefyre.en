# Create an App

Click `uicontrol +New App` from the Apps page, and select an App type from the pulldown menu.

In the `uicontrol New App` dialog that appears, enter an `uicontrol App Title`, select a `uicontrol Site`, and click `uicontrol Create` to open the App Overview page.

The App Summary page provides 4 tabs:

* `uicontrol App Summary:`provides an overview of the App’s content and status, and provides tools to access the App on its site and generate its embed code.
* `uicontrol Designer:`allows you to select design options for the App, including fonts, color schemes, and App specific configuration options.
* `uicontrol Streams:`lists all Stream sources for the App’s content. Click the Stream’s title to open the Stream Details page, from which it may be edited.
* `uicontrol Settings:`allows you to select App specific settings, including rules for adding content to the App, and the types of content to display. Click the `uicontrol Settings:` tab to override the Network and Site Default Settings for the App.
