   <tr> 
    <td>Enhancement</td> 
    <td>UGC Commerce</td> 
    <td>Livefyre customers can now filter the UGC published to their apps only if they have rights granted. For example, a customer can curate and publish a selection of items, but those items will only be rendered in the App once they have been rights granted by the author. This is particularly important for e-commerce use cases, where the UGC is used for commercial purposes.</td>
