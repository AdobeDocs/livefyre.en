# Add Livefyre Components to a Page

>1. From the `uicontrol Components` side panel, select `uicontrol Livefyre` from the pulldown menu to limit the list to available Livefyre components.
>   
>1. Select a Livefyre component, and drag it into position on your page.
>   
>1. Once added, Livefyre Components automatically create a fresh Livefyre App to store and stream the social content rendered by the component. This App will be created in the Livefyre site and network used in the Livefyre Cloud Service Configuration for the AEM Page.
>   >[!NOTE]
>   >
>   >Because a new, empty Livefyre App is created for each added Livefyre component, the component may render with very little content before you add content using Livefyre Studio. For more information on how to add content to a Livefyre App from a page, see Edit a Livefyre Component from an AEM Page.
