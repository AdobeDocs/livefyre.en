# Customize an App

`uicontrol  Style` options are consistent across all App types; `uicontrol  Configuration` options vary by App.
The bottom of the Style and Configuration pane lists the Livefyre App version for your App. If a newer version of the codebase for the App exists, an `uicontrol  Update`button will also be displayed. Click the button to update to the newest release version, and refresh your App with all available feature enhancements and bug fixes. Once updated, preview changes made to your App (if any), then accept or reject the update.

**Select Style Options**

Apps may be styled to fit your site’s branding. Use the `uicontrol  Style` options to select the App’s color and font styles.

* `uicontrol  Theme`. Select `uicontrol  Light` or `uicontrol  Dark` to define the background color for your displayed content. Changes made to this setting will be immediately reflected in the preview to the right. This setting controls background, content text, user handle, timestamp, share button, and social icon color selection for the App.
* `uicontrol  Brand color`. Select a color for your App. This color will be used for hashtags, URLs, usernames, @mentions, bar charts, and other App-specific components, as displayed in the preview pane to the right.
* `uicontrol  Font family`. Select a font for user generated content in your App. Selecting Georgia or Times New Roman will assign that font to content, and Helvetica Neue to usernames and display names. Selecting Helvetica, Verdana, or Trebuchet will assign those fonts to content, usernames, and display names.
* `uicontrol  Font size`. Select a default font size. This setting will affect all user generated content and titles displayed in the App.
