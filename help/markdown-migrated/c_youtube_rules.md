# YouTube Rules

Create YouTube rules based on User, Channel or Playlist.

To create YouTube Rules to pull content from YouTube into your App or Folder, you can filter by:

* `uicontrol User`
    * Enter the vanity string for a `uicontrol User` to include videos from the User in the Stream.
    * For example, If the URL of the User feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/user/livefyresupport, simply enter livefyresupport.
  
* `uicontrol Channel`
    * Enter the vanity string for a `uicontrol Channel` to include videos from a Channel in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Channel feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg, simply enter UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg.
  
* `uicontrol Playlist`
    * Enter the vanity string for a `uicontrol Playlist` to include videos from a Playlist in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Playlist feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE5670C92BDAC201, simply enter PLFE5670C92BDAC201
  
* `uicontrol Include recent items.` If this is set to:
    * `uicontrol Enabled`, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream, regardless of the publication date.
    * `uicontrol Disabled`, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream with a publication date that is the same as the stream rule creation date or later.
