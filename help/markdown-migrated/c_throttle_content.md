# Throttle Content

Use Throttle Content to control high velocity chats, when the real time nature of the content is important. When enabled, Throttle Content throttles high velocity content streams, and displays only content that the system deems most “intelligent.”

When this feature is enabled:

* Users see their own content stream into the page, because is will be deemed “intelligent content” for that user.
* Users can view all previous content upon page load or refresh.
* Moderators will not experience a throttled stream; they see all content stream in.
* Because Moderator-generated content is deemed intelligent, it will always stream into the Collection for all users.
If the velocity drops, Livefyre will display all content, streaming in real-time.

This feature may be enabled at the Collection level using Collection Settings in Studio. You may not Throttle Content at the network or site level.
