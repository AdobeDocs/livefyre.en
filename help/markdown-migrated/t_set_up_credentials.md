# Set up Credentials

**Credentials**
The Credentials panel displays your Livefyre Network and Site Credentials. These fields will be populated by Livefyre during your integration process, and are available here for your reference. New Sites added through Studio will also be included in this page. These values are read-only.

**Network Credentials**
**Note: **Your Network Key is used **only** to generate userAuth tokens and is not used for any other API calls. When constructing collectionMeta tokens, the Site Key is used. For more information, see Developers &gt; Getting Started &gt; [Building a User Auth Token](https://answers.livefyre.com/developers/getting-started/tokens/auth/).
