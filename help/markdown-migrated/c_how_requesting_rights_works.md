# Product: Requesting Rights

The following rights statuses are available from Library Assets, App Content, ModQ, and AEM Commerce:

* `uicontrol Granted`. When the author grants you the right to reuse their content, the status of the asset changes to `uicontrol Granted`.
  *
  `uicontrol Expired`. Livefyre monitors the Instagram and Twitter stream for the authorâ€™s reply for 14 days. After 14 days, the request expires, the rights request status changes to`uicontrol Expired`, and you can send a second request or remove the item from your Library.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Requested`. Request permission for content from the Library. You can do this for one or more assets at a time. After you request permission, Livefyre sets the asset status to `uicontrol Requested`.
  
  
* `uicontrol Needs Review`. If the author replies with a note that does not include your #approvalHashtag, the status of the asset changes to `uicontrol Needs Review`.
* `uicontrol Request Failed`. Request failed to be sent (due to expired token, etc.).
* `uicontrol Request Pending`. Queues the Rights Request so that not too many are sent at one time.
