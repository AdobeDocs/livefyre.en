# Build Server Side Tokens

Building the tokens that Livefyre uses to validate requests ensures that only you can make updates to your Livefyre network.

**CollectionMeta Token**

Learn how to build a token to create new and display existing conversations.

**Auth Token**

Learn how to build a token for authenticating users, a necessary step in the integration process if youâ€™re not using Janrain Capture for user management.

## User Auth Token {#section_l5l_hwt_bbb}

This section describes how to generate the UserAuth JSON Object that creates the User Authentication token required to log users into your Apps.

To create the token, use your preferred language library to pass in the following parameters:

  <colspec colname="c2" colnum="2" colwidth="1.0*" /> 
  <colspec colname="c3" colnum="3" colwidth="1.0*" />
