Feature Card Apps include only standard customizations: `uicontrol Theme`, Brand color, Font family, and Font size.

You can customize Feature Cards using:

* `uicontrol Style` and `uicontrol Config` options for all Apps in the `uicontrol App Designer`. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard `uicontrol Style` and `uicontrol Config` options for all Apps in the `uicontrol App Designer`.
* Integration tools. See App Integrations for more on how to customize Apps using Integration Tools.
* `uicontrol Call-to-action button`
  You can use the Call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.
  
    * `uicontrol Call-to-action button`
      Switch the toggle to on to display the Call-to-action button.
      
      
    * `uicontrol Require rights to display products`
      Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a Call-to-action button appears for the content.
      
      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the Call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.
      
    * `uicontrol Call-to-action header text`
      The words to display in the header above the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default wording is, "Shop these products:".
      
      
    * `uicontrol Call-to-action button text`
      Customize the text on the Call-to-action button. Default text is, "Buy Now."
      
      
    * `uicontrol Product display options`
      Choose whether you want to display the `uicontrol Photo` and the `uicontrol Product name` with the Call-to-action button.
      
      
    * `uicontrol Product URL referral tracking`
      Switch the toggle to on to track referrals from this App to the associated product page.
      
      
    * `uicontrol Referral tracking key-value pairs`
      Add parameters to further specify the referral tracking from your App content to the associated product page.
      
      
  
* `uicontrol Product page filter`
    * `uicontrol Filter UGC by Product ID`. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App.
    * `uicontrol Select Product folders`. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages.
    * `uicontrol Show related content`. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
