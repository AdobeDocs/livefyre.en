# Review App History

App Designer will automatically save all changes made, and generate a new version for each change. Click `uicontrol History` to open a panel listing all versions of your App. Listed versions will show each version’s editor, and its age.

Click on a version to select it, and refresh the preview display in the right pane. Click `uicontrol Restore Version` if you wish to clone the selected version, and begin working from it. Click the back button in the `uicontrol Version History` pane to revert to your working draft. Click `uicontrol Share` to generate a URL for the preview, which may be sent to co-workers or friends for review.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your App may not be edited while the`uicontrol Version History` pane is open.
If another editor makes changes while your browser window is open, a warning message will be issued when you try to edit the App, asking if you wish to return to your (older) draft version. (This prevents multiple simultaneous editors from accidentally ignoring each other’s changes.) Click `uicontrol Update` to Latest to begin working from the latest version. Click `uicontrol Overwrite` to return to your (older) working state, increment the version number from the most recent, and continue working.
