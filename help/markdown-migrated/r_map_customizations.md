The following options are available from the Map app:

  *
  `uicontrol Cluster number`
  
  Sets the color for the numbers listed above each content cluster in the App.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Show zoom controls`
  
  Allows users to control the zoom level of your Map.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Allow panning`
  
  Enables panning for your Map, allowing users to drag and reposition the map.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Enable content modal`
  
  Allows users to click on a piece of content to open it in a popup window.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Enable clustering`
  
  Creates clickable groups of content, scaled to user zoom.
  
  
  *
  `uicontrol Embedded height / Embedded width`
  
  Allows you to set the pixel size at which the Map will be embedded on your site. (Optional.)
  
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If your web developers have defined a`uicontrol height` for your Map on the page, these values will be overridden, and your Map will follow responsive design sizing conventions. If they have not defined a height, these values will be used, and your Map will be placed at a set size (non-responsive design). If these fields are left blank, the value will default to 600px wide by 400px high, and the Map will not be responsive.
  
  *
  `uicontrol Location`
  
  Enter the location around which you wish your map to be centered. Use the slider beneath the preview map to define the zoom.
  
  
You can customize the Map app using:

* `uicontrol Style` and `uicontrol Config` options for all Apps in the `uicontrol App Designer`. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard `uicontrol Style` and `uicontrol Config` options for all Apps in the `uicontrol App Designer`.
* Integration tools. See Map for more on how to customize Apps using Integration Tools.
