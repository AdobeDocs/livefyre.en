# Request Rights Using AEM Assets

You must select UGC to import into AEM Assets before you can request rights for those assets. You can:

* Send a message to the owners of multiple assets at a time by using `uicontrol Bulk Message`
* Override the rights for multiple assets at once using `uicontrol Bulk Attribute Content Rights`
* Choose whether you want to message the content owner or manually attribute content rights for each asset you selected using `uicontrol Custom Actions`.
>[!NOTE]
>
>If any content item previously had rights requested or granted in the Livefyre platform, the status of the rights request will reflect appropriately for the content item.
>[!NOTE]
>
>Overriding a rights request is stating that you own the content. Do not override a rights request without verifying that you own the content.
