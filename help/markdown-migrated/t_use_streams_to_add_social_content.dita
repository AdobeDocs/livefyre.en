            <note>You cannot edit the Streams a story uses from the Storify 2 App.</note>
            <p>When SAFE Rules are enabled in Network Settings, streamed content will be filtered
                through SAFE. Unsafe content will be prevented from displaying in the Streams
                Tab.</p>
            <p>To edit or turn a stream off, go to the Streams section of the Livefyre Engagement
                Cloud. See Managing Streams for more information on how to edit, delete, and turn
                off Streams.</p>
            <p>Use a Stream in a Story to:</p>
            <ul id="ul_bkj_hlx_qy">
                <li>Prepare Streams in advance and quickly access their content while drafting your
                    Story.</li>
                <li>View a real-time feed of social media content right from the Content Pane.</li>
                <li>Manually select pieces of content from the Stream and drag and drop them where
                    it makes sense in your Story.</li>
                <li>Choose when to publish posts with streamed contentÂ as a Story unfolds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before you use Streams to add social content to your Story, you must create a stream.
