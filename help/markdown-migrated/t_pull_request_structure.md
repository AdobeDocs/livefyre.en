# Pull Request Structure

Livefyre issues a Pull request to your endpoint URL.

For example, if your Pull endpoint URL is:

```
http://example.yoursite.com/some_path/?id={id}
```
the Livefyre Pull request to this endpoint will be:

```
http://example.yoursite.com/some_path/?id={id}&amp;lftoken={UserAuthToken}
```
where `codeph lftoken` is a JSON Web Token signed with your network key, and `uicontrol {userAuthToken}` is the user auth token generated by Livefyre.

>1. Use `codeph lftoken` to validate that requests to your Ping for Pull URL were sent by Livefyre and not a malicious agent.
>   
>1. For all incoming requests:
>* Ensure that the `codeph lftoken` query string is present on the request.
>* Use the `codeph validateLivefyreToken` method in the Livefyre libraries to ensure that `codeph lftoken` was signed with your Network Key.
>* If `codeph lftoken` is not present, or fails validation, do not allow your endpoint to respond with profile information. Instead, respond with a 403 (Forbidden) status code and no response body.
>   
>   
>1. `codeph userAuthToken` is generated by the Livefyre `codeph buildUserAuthToken` method for the user, with user id “system”. This user is the first user created for every new network.
>   
>1. To test your page, use our [Ping for Pull](http://livefyre-p4p-wizard.herokuapp.com/home) tester to confirm everything works as expected.
