# Add Livefyre Components to Individual Pages

After you install and configure the Livefyre for AEM package, you can add Livefyre social components to any AEM page.

To add Livefyre components to your page, the page must inherit a Livefyre Cloud Service configuration from its parent page or have the configuration added directly to the page.
