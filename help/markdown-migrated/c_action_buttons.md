# Action Buttons

Custom action buttons, and the associated action, can be added to any user or piece of content in any Livefyre App, alongside the existing Flag, Share, Delete buttons. Examples could be enabling a user to hide content from another user, or to follow a user.

For technical information on adding custom action buttons, please see Adding Custom Buttons.
