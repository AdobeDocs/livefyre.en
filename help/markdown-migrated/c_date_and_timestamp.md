# Date and Timestamp

Change the date and timestamp format to meet your needs.

By default, Livefyre Apps display a relative timestamp for posts to the stream (4 minutes ago, 5 hours ago, 8 days ago, 2 months ago).

You may customize the timestamp displayed using the Date and Timestamp Customization, which allows you to select from a list of available formats.
