# Add Content to a Library

Studio allows you to add content to your Library from the Social Search tab and from the All Assets tab. The Social Search tab allows you to search for content from Twitter and Instagram. Use the folder view to search for content locally, or from other content providers, including Flickr, Dropbox, your Google Drive, and any input URL.
