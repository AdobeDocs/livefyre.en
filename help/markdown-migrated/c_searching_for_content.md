# Search for Content from Twitter and Instagram Using the Social Search

To search for content:

* Select the social network you wish to search from the left side of the search bar (Twitter or Instagram).
* Enter your search criteria.
Results returned will be listed from most recent to least.

Items matching your search are displayed in a grid view. Mouse over an item to `uicontrol View Details`, add it to your Asset Library, or `uicontrol Publish` to an App.

You can save and reuse searches. Click in the search bar to see a list of your Recent and Saved Searches.

When you add new assets to the library, assets that are already included in your library are marked with a checkmark.
