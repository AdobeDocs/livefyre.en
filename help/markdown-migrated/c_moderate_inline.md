# Moderate Content from a Stream

Moderators can approve or reject pending comments directly from the stream, using the Library.

To moderate pending content, simply mouse over the `uicontrol Pending` button.

The `uicontrol Pending` button changes and you can select whether to Deny (`uicontrol x`) or Approve (`uicontrol ✓`) the comment.

Mouse over the comment space and the following moderation options display:

  *
  `uicontrol Ban user:` bans the user from adding content to the site.
  
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This option is site-specific, and will not ban the user from your entire network. For Sidenotes, users may be banned only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.
  
* `uicontrol Bozo:` Bozos the content’s author. For Sidenotes, users may be Bozo’d only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.
* `uicontrol Delete:` Deletes the content from the thread.
* `uicontrol Flag:` Opens a Flag modal, allowing you to select a flag for the content (Spam, Offensive, Disagree, or Off-Topic), enter an email address to associate with the Flag, if desired, and add a note.
* `uicontrol Share:` Opens a Share modal, which allows you to share to Facebook or Twitter, edit the text, and include a permalink to the content itself.
* `uicontrol Feature:` Features the content.
