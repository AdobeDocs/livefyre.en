# Instagram Content Guidelines

You must configure an *Instagram personal account* in order to create Instagram streams using all fields except **[!UICONTROL  By Author]**.

You must configure an *Instagram business account *to create Instagram streams from a specific Instagram user account by using the **[!UICONTROL  By Author]** field. The user account you identify in the **[!UICONTROL  By Author]** field, must be a business account.

For more information on how to set up an Instagram Business Account in Livefyre, see[](t_configure_social_accout_instagram/c_about_instagram_accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts).]

Instagram adheres to the rule that the content belongs to the user, who must give permission for their content to be used. To follow this requirement, Livefyre suggests that you:

* Promote and select hashtags that are unique to your brand, so users are “explicitly” joining the campaign.
* Use one (1) hashtag instead of several for any given campaign or promotion, allowing you to track by a single, specific filter.
* Use specific, rather than generic words in the hashtag search. Using generic words may yield unexpected results, and may include users who did not intend for their photo to be used in relation to your campaign.
Instagram, like other brands, also has requirements for using their brand assets. For example, photos must:

* Provide attribution to Instagram and the owner of the content.
* Be clearly differentiated from other social media content if displayed together with other networks’ media.
