# About Instagram Accounts

Learn the rules and requirements for Instagram that are different than other social accounts.

You must configure an *Instagram personal account* in order to:

* Perform an Instagram social search by tags or location.
* Create Instagram streams for all fields except **[!UICONTROL By Author]**.
* Manually request rights for assets from Instagram.

You must configure an *Instagram business account* to:

* Perform an Instagram social search by user (user must be an Instagram business account also).
* Create Instagram streams from a specific Instagram user account (the account must also be a business account).
* Request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow

For information on how to create an Instagram business account or convert an Instagram personal account to a business account, see [How do I set up a business profile on Instagram?](https://www.facebook.com/help/502981923235522)

>[!NOTE]

>Livefyre recommends you set up both personal and business Instagram accounts so you can take advantage of the full functionality of using Livefyre with Instagram.
