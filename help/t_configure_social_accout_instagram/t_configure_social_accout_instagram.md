# Add a Social Account

Livefyre uses Twitter and Instagram social accounts to enable you to perform a social search (in the Library) or to use Streams.

You must configure an account in Twitter in order to use the Twitter social search in the Library. 

Instagram has different rules for social accounts, depending on how you use Adobe Livefyre. For information on what type of social accounts you can use with Livefyre, see [](../t_configure_social_accout_instagram/c_about_instagram_accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts).

>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Add Account]** under the type of social account you are adding. A dialog box pops up to allow you to authorize the account for Livefyre.
