* Request Rights from App Content. For more information on how to request rights from the App Content, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
* Request Rights from ModQ. For more information on how to request rights from the ModQ, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works)
* Request Rights from AEM Commerce. For more information on how to request rights from AEM Commerce. See [](t_request_rights_using_aem_assets.md#t_request_rights_using_aem_assets).
* Search for content with a specific rights status in the Library or App Content to follow-up on previous rights requests. For more on how to manage content with previous rights requests, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
* View the rights request history for a piece of content. For more information on how to view the history of rights requests for a piece of content, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
* Manually override the rights for one or more assets at a time. For more on how to manually grant rights, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
