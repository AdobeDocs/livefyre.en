# Featured Content{#featured-content}

Highlight important content to your users by using CSS to custom style Featured content.

Any piece of content in a Collection can be tagged as “featured” by your network site owners or moderators, in order to highlight important content and encourage high quality replies from other users. Once a piece of content has been featured, a **[!UICONTROL Featured]** tag will be displayed on the content in the app, so that users can easily identify content that owners and moderators have highlighted.

In Comments:

* The two most recent pieces of **[!UICONTROL Featured]** content will also be pulled above the stream.
* It may take up to seven minutes for Featured content to appear above the editor.
* A **[!UICONTROL Featured]** tag may be added to any comment within the stream, and used to style the comment, but only Livefyre-native user generated content will appear above the editor.

When content is unfeatured, the **[!UICONTROL Featured]** tag displayed will be removed in real-time.

Once a piece of content has been featured, a **[!UICONTROL Featured]** badge will be displayed on the content in the app, and you may use the fyre-featured CSS class to custom style the content.
