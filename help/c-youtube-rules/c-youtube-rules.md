# YouTube Rules{#youtube-rules}

You can create Stream rules that pull content from YouTube rules.

Create YouTube rules based on User, Channel or Playlist.

To create YouTube Rules to pull content from YouTube into your App or Folder, you can filter by:

* **[!UICONTROL User]**

    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL User]** to include videos from the User in the Stream.
    * For example, If the URL of the User feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/user/livefyresupport, simply enter livefyresupport.

* **[!UICONTROL Channel]**

    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL Channel]** to include videos from a Channel in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Channel feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg, simply enter UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg.

* **[!UICONTROL Playlist]**

    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL Playlist]** to include videos from a Playlist in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Playlist feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE5670C92BDAC201, simply enter PLFE5670C92BDAC201

* **[!UICONTROL Include recent items.]** If this is set to:

    * **[!UICONTROL Enabled]**, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream, regardless of the publication date.
    * **[!UICONTROL Disabled]**, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream with a publication date that is the same as the stream rule creation date or later.

For additional Stream rule options for all Stream rules, see [Stream Rule Options for All Stream Rules](../c-stream-rule-options-for-all-stream-rules.md#c_stream_rule_options_for_all_stream_rules).
