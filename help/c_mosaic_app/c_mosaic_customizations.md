# Mosaic Customizations

Change the size, width, and interaction options of the Mosaic app.

 All Apps use **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer.]**

You can customize Mosaic using the following additional options in the App Designer:

* **[!UICONTROL Content interaction]**. Sets the style with which new content will be loaded onto the page:

    * **[!UICONTROL Hover Fade]** to fade to the other side of a card when a site visitor hovers their mouse over the content.
    * **[!UICONTROL Hover Flip]** to flip to the other side of a card when a site visitor hovers their mouse over the content.
    * **[!UICONTROL Click]** to display the other side of a card when a site visitor clicks their mouse on the content.

* **[!UICONTROL Number of Tiles to Load]**. The number of tiles to load in a Mosaic. This can affect the output display. Mosaic will not display in a grid unless you choose the correct number of tiles to correspond to the container width. You may need to adjust these for the grid to display correctly. 
* **[!UICONTROL Hide social branding when rights granted]** Switch this on to remove the logo for the originating social media network (Twitter or Instagram) when rights are granted for a piece of content. 

* **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** You can use the Call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.

    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** Switch the toggle to on to display the Call-to-action button.
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Require rights to display products]** Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a Call-to-action button appears for the content.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the Call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.

    * **[!UICONTROL Show call-to-action in tile]**. Choose whether to display the call-to-action button on a Filmstrip tile instead of displaying the call-to-action button only when the site visitor clicks on a card and opens the content in a larger window.
    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action indication text]** The text to display to prompt the user to click on the card to open the Call-to-action modal.
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action header text]** The words to display in the header above the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default wording is, "Shop these products:".
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button text]** Customize the text on the Call-to-action button. Default text is, "Buy Now."
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Product display options]** Choose whether you want to display the **[!UICONTROL Photo]** and the **[!UICONTROL Product name]** with the Call-to-action button. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Product URL referral tracking]** Switch the toggle to on to track referrals from this App to the associated product page. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Referral tracking key-value pairs]** Add parameters to further specify the referral tracking from your App content to the associated product page.

* **[!UICONTROL Product page filter]**.

    * **[!UICONTROL Filter UGC by Product ID]**. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select Product folders]**. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages.
    * **[!UICONTROL Show related content]**. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
