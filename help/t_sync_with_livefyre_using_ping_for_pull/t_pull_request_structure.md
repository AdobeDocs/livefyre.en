# Pull Request Structure

Livefyre issues a Pull request to your endpoint URL.

For example, if your Pull endpoint URL is:

```
http://example.yoursite.com/some_path/?id={id}
```
the Livefyre Pull request to this endpoint will be:

```
http://example.yoursite.com/some_path/?id={id}&amp;lftoken={UserAuthToken}
```
where ` lftoken` is a JSON Web Token signed with your network key, and **[!UICONTROL  {userAuthToken}]** is the user auth token generated by Livefyre.

>1. Use ` lftoken` to validate that requests to your Ping for Pull URL were sent by Livefyre and not a malicious agent.
>1. For all incoming requests:
>    
>    * Ensure that the ` lftoken` query string is present on the request.
>    * Use the ` validateLivefyreToken` method in the Livefyre libraries to ensure that ` lftoken` was signed with your Network Key.
>    * If ` lftoken` is not present, or fails validation, do not allow your endpoint to respond with profile information. Instead, respond with a 403 (Forbidden) status code and no response body.
>    
>1. ` userAuthToken` is generated by the Livefyre ` buildUserAuthToken` method for the user, with user id “system”. This user is the first user created for every new network.
>1. To test your page, use our [ Ping for Pull ](http://livefyre-p4p-wizard.herokuapp.com/home) tester to confirm everything works as expected.
