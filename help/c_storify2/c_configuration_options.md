# Configuration Options

**Style Options**

* **[!UICONTROL  Theme]**

  Select **Light** or **Dark** to define the background color for your displayed content. Changes made to this setting will be immediately reflected in the preview to the right. This setting controls background, content text, user handle, timestamp, share button, and social icon color selection for the App.

* **[!UICONTROL  Brand color]**

  Select a color for your App. This color will be used for hashtags, URLs, usernames, @mentions, bar charts, and other App-specific components, as displayed in the preview pane to the right.

* **[!UICONTROL  Font family]**

  Select a font for user generated content in your App. Selecting Georgia or Times New Roman will assign that font to content, and Helvetica Neue to usernames and display names. Selecting Helvetica, Verdana, or Trebuchet will assign those fonts to content, usernames, and display names.

* **[!UICONTROL  Posts appear in cards]**

  If enabled, posts will be displayed within a surrounding box, and the background color dictated by the Theme selection applied.

* **[!UICONTROL  Show header]**

  If enabled, the story’s header (sort menu and number of viewers) will be displayed.

**Display**

* **[!UICONTROL  Byline]**

  If enabled, you may select whether to list the original author’s name, or a team name as the byline for your Story.

  >[!NOTE]

* **[!UICONTROL  Byline type]** 

  If **[!UICONTROL  Byline]** is enabled, this pulldown allows you to select the type of byline to be displayed: team byline, or individual bylines. Use the field below **[!UICONTROL  Byline type]** to enter the text to display as byline.

  Allows you to select the time zone to be used for the Story. This location will be used to timestamp all Posts within the Story. (End users will see this translated to their local time, but may hover over the timestamp they see to reveal the timestamp set for the Story.)

* **[!UICONTROL  Load more posts]**

  Choose whether posts display continuously as a user scrolls down or whether to display a Show More button.

**[!UICONTROL  User Engagement]**

  If enabled, users may add Sidenotes to your posts.
