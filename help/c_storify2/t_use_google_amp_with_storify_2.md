# Use Google AMP with Storify 2

To use Google AMP with Storify 2, you must create a page for your Storify 2 App with Google AMP markup. 

The AMP version of the App requests updates from the original page (use the **pollInterval** parameter in the **amp-live-list** API to set the interval for update requests). To ensure that visitors on your AMP page get the most up-to-date content quickly, keep a low-cache TTL on your Storify 2 AMP pages.

Non-image assets (for example, videos) included as posts in a Storify 2 App must use HTTPS as specified by the AMP specification. AMP URLs that use Google Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) use HTTPS.

To use Google AMP with Storify 2:

>1. Create an AMP-validated template on your site.
>1. Use one or more of the following Google AMP APIs to customize your Google AMP page:
>   >1. [ amp-iframe](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-iframe) to customize the Storify 2 display
>   >1. [ amp-live-list](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-live-list) to customize the time interval for updates
>   >1. [ amp-social-share](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-social-share) to add a social sharing button
>1. Include the contents of the following Storify 2 AMP page into the CSS for your Storify 2 page within the &lt;style amp-custom&gt; tag: [ https://cdn.livefyre.com/libs/liveblog-v2-component/amp.min.css](https://cdn.livefyre.com/libs/liveblog-v2-component/amp.min.css)
>1. Include the contents of the following Storify 2 AMP markup API into your Google AMP template: https://api.livefyre.com/app-service/v4/bootstrap/{{APP_ID}}/amp where {{APP_ID}} is the App ID for the Storify 2 App in Livefyre Studio.
>   >1. The only query parameter is **pollInterval**, which is the interval in which the app will check for updates (set in milliseconds).
>   >1. The URL includes content from the most recent posts (including Tweets, videos, etc.)
>   >1. The publisher page needs to get content from this URL as often as you want the Google AMP page to be updated.
