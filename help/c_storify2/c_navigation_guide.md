# Navigation Guide

A Navigation Guide can be added to your Storify 2 application to create a list of permalinked posts in a prominent location next to your story. 

To add a Navigation Guide to your Storify, turn it on in App Designer. Choose the number of post highlights to display in the Navigation Guide and the location of the Navigation Guide. You must create a header for each Storify post for it to display in the Navigation Guide.

Use the **[!UICONTROL  Navigation Guide]** toggle in the **[!UICONTROL  App Designer]** to turn the Navigation Guide on or off. The Navigation Guide can take up to 5 minutes to display after you turn it on and for posts to display or stop displaying in the guide. 

Enter a title for the Navigation Guide.

Use the field **[!UICONTROL  Max Number of Guide Posts]** to set the maximum number of posts to add to the Navigation Guide. The default number of posts is 10. If you choose less than 10, the Navigation Guide automatically adjusts the size to fit the space.

* If you pin a post, the pinned post will always be the first in the Navigation Guide.
* Add a new post to the Navigation Guide by adding a header to a Storify 2 post and selecting the Navigation Guide icon on the post.
* When you add a new post to the Navigation Guide, the post fits into the existing Navigation Guide structure in the order the posts appear in the story.
* If you select more posts to display in the Navigation Guide than the Max Number of Guide Posts, then the last post on the Navigation Guide list is removed.
Use the field **[!UICONTROL  Orientation]** to determine the placement of the Navigation Guide: top, left, or right.

* Choose **[!UICONTROL  top]** orientation to place the Navigation Guide at the top of the Storify 2. You will not see the Navigation Guide when you scroll down the page even if you turn on the Stickiness field.
* Choose **[!UICONTROL  left]** orientation to place the Navigation Guide in the left sidebar inside the Storify 2. You will not see the Navigation Guide when you scroll down the page unless you turn on the Stickiness field. If you turn on the Stickiness field, you will always see the Navigation Guide to the left of the page while scrolling.
* Choose the **[!UICONTROL  right]** orientation to place the Navigation Guide to the right of the Storify 2. You will not see the Navigation Guide when you scroll down the page unless you turn on the Stickiness field. If you turn on the Stickiness field, you will always see the Navigation Guide to the right of the page while scrolling.
Use the field **[!UICONTROL  Stickiness]** to keep the Navigation Guide sticking to the top of the screen. Sticky means that the Navigation Guide stays at the top of the screen no matter where you are on a page on which Storify 2 is embedded. 

Use the field **[!UICONTROL  App Embed]** to determine the location of the Navigation Guide to live inside the page container with the Storify or outside it.
