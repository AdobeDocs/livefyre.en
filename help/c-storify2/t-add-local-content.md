# Add Text{#add-text}

Storify allows you to add content at any position in your story.

Use the Editorâ€™s Content Pane to view your drafts and find pieces of content to add context to your story. Use the Editor Tab to create a storyline, add context to your story elements, and build a narrative for the page.

Content elements may be edited or repositioned. Text may be styled using standard formatting options, including bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough.

1. Click in the page to create a new text element, which may then be dragged to reposition it anywhere within your storyline.
1. Click on existing text, then use the formatting menu bar that opens to restyle it. Available options include headlines, quotes, ordered and unordered lists, bold, strikethrough, underline, and italic.
