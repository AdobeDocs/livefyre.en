# YouTube Rules

Create YouTube rules based on User, Channel or Playlist.

To create YouTube Rules to pull content from YouTube into your App or Folder, you can filter by:

* **[!UICONTROL  User]**
    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL  User]** to include videos from the User in the Stream.
    * For example, If the URL of the User feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/user/livefyresupport, simply enter livefyresupport.

* **[!UICONTROL  Channel]**
    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL  Channel]** to include videos from a Channel in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Channel feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg, simply enter UCeNZlh03MyUkjRlLFpVQxsg.

* **[!UICONTROL  Playlist]**
    * Enter the vanity string for a **[!UICONTROL  Playlist]** to include videos from a Playlist in the Stream.
    * For example, if the URL of the Playlist feed you wish to input is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE5670C92BDAC201, simply enter PLFE5670C92BDAC201

* **[!UICONTROL  Include recent items.]** If this is set to:
    * **[!UICONTROL  Enabled]**, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream, regardless of the publication date.
    * **[!UICONTROL  Disabled]**, Livefyre adds the first 15 content items in your feed to the stream with a publication date that is the same as the stream rule creation date or later.

For additional Stream rule options for all Stream rules, see [ Stream Rule Options for All Stream Rules](c_stream_rule_options_for_all_stream_rules.md#c_stream_rule_options_for_all_stream_rules).
