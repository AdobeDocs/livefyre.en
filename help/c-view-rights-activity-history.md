# View Rights Activity History{#view-rights-activity-history}

Livefyre keeps an audit trail of your rights activity.

Livefyre tracks:

* Requests sent to a social network user.
* Replies from a social network user on rights requests.
* Content status changes. Livefyre tracks which user changed the status and when they changed the status. 
* Notes entered by a user on a rights management request.
* System error messages.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Livefyre automatically tracks rights requests for Instagram only if you use an Instagram business account to perform a search or stream by a business account author. If you obtained content from an Instagram search or stream by hashtag, URL, or location, Livefyre will only track manual actions performed in Livefyre (for example, Livefyre tracks if you manually grant rights).
