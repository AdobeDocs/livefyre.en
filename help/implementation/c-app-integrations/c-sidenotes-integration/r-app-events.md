# Sidenotes App Events {#sidenotes-app-events}

You can listen to events on an instance of Sidenotes.

Callbacks can be registered with the `onmethod` and unregistered with the `removeListener` method. A `once` method is available for convenience if the callback is to be called only once and then unregistered.

```
var app = Livefyre.Sidenotes(convConfig); 
   app.once('sidenotes.initialized', function () { 
     // Sidenotes initialized!  
});
```

For more information on Livefyre events, see the JavaScript Events page in the Reference section.
