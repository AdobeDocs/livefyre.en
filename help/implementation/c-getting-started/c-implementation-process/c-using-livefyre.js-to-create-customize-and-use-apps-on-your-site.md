# Embed an App{#embed-an-app}

Add Livefyre Apps to your web pages using the Livefyre.js embed code structure.

This documentation is intended for a technical audience. For [non-technical information about Apps](c_about_apps.md#c_about_apps).

This section describes the code structure that you’ll need to include in your page template to embed Livefyre Apps on your site.

1. Create an .html file with a Livefyre placeholder.

   Create a new .html file in the text editor of your choice. Create a placeholder Livefyre `<div>` element in which the App will be embedded.

   ```
   <html> 
      <head> </head> 
      <body> 
         <div id='livefyre'> </div> 
      </body> 
   </html>
   ```

1. Include the Livefyre.js Library.

   Then, include the Livefyre JS Library. Place the following reference in a `<script>` element in your `<head>` element. Then, open your page in a browser and use your browser’s web inspector to confirm that Livefyre is loaded.

   ```
   <head> 
      <script src='@{livefyre_js}'></script> 
   </head> 
   
   ```

1. Construct the Livefyre App.

   Use `Livefyre.require` to construct both Core and SDK Apps by passing in the Livefyre package(s) you plan to use.

    1. Build a Core App.

       To build a Core App (Comments, Live Blog, or Chat), use the following structure:

       ```    
       Livefyre.require(['fyre.conv#@{fyre_conv_version_prod}'], function(Conv) { 
            new Conv(networkConfig, [convConfig], function(widget) {});  
       });  
       
       ```

    1. Build an SDK App.

       To build an SDK App such as Media Wall or Feed, use the following structure:

       ```    
              Livefyre.require(['app#{version_number}'], 
          function (App, SDK) { 
             var app = new App({ 
             el: document.getElementById('app'), 
          }); 
          var collection = new SDK.Collection({ 
             network: "`labs.fyre.co`", 
             environment: "livefyre.com", 
             siteId: "315833", 
             articleId: 'livefyre-tweets' 
          }); 
          collection.pipe(feed); 
       }); 
       
       ```    
    
       See [more information on specific Apps](c_about_apps.md#c_about_apps). It is recommended that you pin to the latest major version of the package (which can be found through [Livefyre.require](https://cdn.livefyre.com/packages.html)), to avoid unexpected broken integrations.
