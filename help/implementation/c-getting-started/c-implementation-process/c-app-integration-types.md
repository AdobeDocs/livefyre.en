# CMS App Integrations{#cms-app-integrations}

When you implement Livefyre Apps, the style of implementation depends on your use case. This page explains the features for the three ways you can create an App.

Livefyre integration is agnostic to any CMS and User Profile and Auth platform. Implement Livefyre in one or more ways, depending on your use-case and requirements.

You can use traditional integration to create customized AEM components.
