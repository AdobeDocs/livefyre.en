# Start Here {#getting-started-with-livefyre-integration}

When you get started with Livefyre, you will:

* Perform the [implementation process](../c-getting-started/c-implementation-process/c-implementation-process.md#c_implementation_process).
* Decide your use case for implementing Livefyre Apps.
* Decide whether you want to use visualization Apps, conversation Apps, or both.

  Visualization Apps are Apps that display content visually, including Carousel, Filmstrip, Media Wall, and Mosaic.

  Conversation Apps are Apps that engage a site visitor in writing content that other site visitors can read, including Comments, Chat, and Reviews.

* Decide if you will need authentication. If you already have a user management system (for example, Janrain, Giya), you can integrate it with Livefyre. If you don't, you can use Livefyre Identity, a built-in, lightweight user management system. For [more about integrating authentication](../t-about-identity-integration/t-about-identity-integration.md#t_about_identity_integration).
