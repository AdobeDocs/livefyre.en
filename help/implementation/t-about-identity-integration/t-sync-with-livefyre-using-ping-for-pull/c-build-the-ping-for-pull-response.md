# Build the Ping for Pull Response{#build-the-ping-for-pull-response}

Build the Ping for Pull response to transmit updated user information to Livefyre.

|Type|Property|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|String *required*|id|The user ID of the user in your profile system. This must be unique across all users in your Network, and must never change.|
|String *required*|display_name|The display name of the user. This will be rendered with Livefyre Content posted by the user.|
|Object *optional, but recommended*|name|Strings to define the user’s formatted, first, middle, and last names.|
|String *optional, but recommended*|email|User’s email address. Used to send email notifications.|
|String *optional, but recommended*|image_url|URL to an avatar to display for the user. Livefyre scales uploaded images to 100×100, 75×75, or 50×50 pixels, as appropriate. For best results, users should upload a square image, at 100×100 pixels. To ensure the avatar image is updated in Livefyre, modify the image_url for each image update so Ping for Pull detects that the image was changed. For example, attach a timestamp to the filename or increment the image changes. Note:  All URLs must be fully qualified and accessible.|
|String *optional, but recommended*|profile_url|URL to the user’s profile page on your site.|
|String *optional, but recommended*|settings_url|URL to a page where users may configure the user’s profile settings for your site.|

|Object *optional, but recommended*|email_notifications|Defines the frequency of available Livefyre email notifications. Different frequencies may be set for each notification type. By default, no notifications will be sent. <br><ul><li> immediately issues notifications immediately upon the listed event. </li><li>often issues notifications in batches. </li><li> never will not send email notification for the activity. </li><li>*comments*: Defines when notifications are sent when other users post content into Collections that this user is following. </li><li>*replies*: Defines when notifications are sent when another user replies to this user’s content.</li><li>*likes*: Defines when notifications are sent when another user likes this user’s content.</li><li>*moderator_comments*: Defines when notifications are sent to moderators when users post content to any Collection in the Network.</li><li>*moderator_flags*: Defines when notifications are sent to moderators when other users flag content in any Collection in the Network.</li></ul>|
