# Janrain Capture/Backplane{#janrain-capture-backplane}

Customers using Janrain Capture and Backplane may use Livefyre Auth for Single Sign On (SSO), allowing users to immediately engage with your Livefyre Apps when they log into your site.

To benefit from this built-in Capture/Backplane integration, you must make configuration changes to both your Capture app and your Livefyre.js integration.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Skip this section if you’re not using Janrain Capture.

For more information, see [Janrain’s Backplane documentation](https://developers.janrain.com/how-to/integrations/self-serve-integrations-and-tools/backplane-1-2/).

1. [Set Up Capture.](#c_janrain_capture_backplane/section_r2f_kxt_bbb) 
1. (Optional) [Add Livefyre Defaults to your Capture App](#c_janrain_capture_backplane/section_z2s_txt_bbb).
1. [Build the AuthDelegate Object.](#c_janrain_capture_backplane/section_asv_vyt_bbb) 
1. [Sync to Livefyre with Ping for Pull.](#c_janrain_capture_backplane/section_ilv_bzt_bbb)

## Step 1: Set Up Capture {#section_r2f_kxt_bbb}

Livefyre needs certain credentials from your Janrain Capture app.

1. Set up the Janrain Capture app. 
1. Gather the following information for Livefyre:

    * Access to your Janrain Capture instance.
    * Access to your Janrain Engage dashboard.
    * Your Capture settings and credentials.
    * Your Engage credentials.
    * Your identity URL.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Livefyre receives data directly from the CNAME; therefore, this identity URL cannot be a CNAMEd record (a vanity URL CNAME) that resolves to the Janrain Capture’s actual CNAME.

## Step 2: (Optional) Add Livefyre Defaults to your Capture App {#section_z2s_txt_bbb}

Add Livefyre defaults to users stored in your Capture app to enable you to send users email notifications or allow them to automatically follow conversations that users comment on.

1. Complete [Step 1: Set Up Capture](#c_janrain_capture_backplane/section_r2f_kxt_bbb).
1. Add the following Livefyre default fields. All fields are optional.

|  Parameter  | Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_comments]** | String  | Notify user when someone comments on an article that they’re following. Can be immediately, often, or never.  |
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_likes]** | String  | Notify user when someone likes one of their posts. Can be immediately, often, or never.  |
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_replies]** | String  | Notify user when someone replies to one of their posts.Can be immediately, often, or never.  |
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_moderator_comments]** | String  | Notify moderator when someone comments on a conversation that they’re moderating.Can be immediately, often, or never.  |
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_moderator_flags]** | String  | Notify moderator when someone flags a post on a conversation that they’re moderating.Can be immediately, often, or never.  |
|  **[!UICONTROL livefyre_autofollow_conversations]** | Boolean  | Have the user auto-follow a conversation when they leave a post. Can be true or false.  |

## Step 3: Build the AuthDelegate Object for Janrain Integration {#section_asv_vyt_bbb}

Livefyre.require provides a plugin that enables auth to listen to the Janrain Backplane bus.

### Login {#login}

When an identity/login message is broadcast on the Backplane channel, auth.authenticate() will be called for you with the user’s Livefyre Authentication token. You must still implement an AuthDelegate.

```
Livefyre.require(['auth', 'backplane-auth-plugin#0'], function(auth, backplanePluginFactory) { 
   auth.plugin(backplanePluginFactory('network.fyre.co')); 
   auth.delegate({ 
      login: function (finishLogin) { 
         loginWithCapture(finishLogin); 
      } 
   }); 
});
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>The window.Backplane object must be defined on your page before calling auth.plugin with the Livefyre Backplane plugin. To make sure the Backplane object is available, call the Livefyre instantiation code from an onReady callback. Consult your Janrain contact to determine when other applications may use the Backplane object.



>[!NOTE]
>
>Your auth delegate will vary depending upon your Janrain instance.

The following are some examples of how an auth delegate may look for a Janrain Capture integration.

* `errback`: The callback passed to your auth delegate’s login method
* `janrain`: The reference to your Janrain capture variable.
* `window.Backplane`: A reference to your Backplane object.

```
/** 
* Login function 
* In this case, opens a login modal and triggers Backplane to start listening 
* for login messages 
*/ 
authDelegate.login = function(finishLogin) { 
   var successCallback = function() { 
      // These need to be replaced with the actions that correspond to successful login  
      // and when the Janrain modal is closed. 
      janrain.events.onCaptureLoginSuccess.removeHandler(successCallback); 
      janrain.events.onModalClose.removeHandler(failureCallback); 
      finishLogin(); 
   }; 
  
   var failureCallback = function(e) { 
      janrain.events.onModalClose.removeHandler(failureCallback); 
      janrain.events.onCaptureLoginSuccess.removeHandler(successCallback); 
      finishLogin(e || new Error("Error logging in with Janrain Capture")); 
   }; 
  
   // Open the modal to log a user in 
   janrain.capture.ui.renderScreen('signIn'); 
   // Send a backplane message 
   window.Backplane.expectMessages('identity/login'); 
   // Add handlers to specific janrain events 
   janrain.events.onCaptureLoginSuccess.addHandler(successCallback); 
   janrain.events.onModalClose.addHandler(failureCallback); 
};
```

### Logout {#logout}

* `finishLogout`: The callback passed to your auth delegate’s login method.

* `window.Backplane`: A reference to your Backplane object.

```
/** 
* Logout function 
* In this case, invalidates the session and removes the cookie. 
* Also reloads the page to change state. In order to do this without a reload, 
* it would be necessary to also update the UI. 
*/ 
authDelegate.logout = function(finishLogout) { 
   Backplane.resetCookieChannel(); 
   janrain.capture.ui.endCaptureSession(); 
   finishLogout(); 
}; 

```

### Edit Profile {#editprofile}

This can link to whatever part of the site you would like users to visit to view their own profile page. This example merely prints out the author object passed in.

```
/** 
* Edit profile function 
* @param user - User who would like to edit their profile 
*/ 
authDelegate.editProfile = function(user) { 
   console.log(user); 
}; 

```

### View Profile {#viewprofile}

Like Edit Profile, this should link to a user’s page that is different from the currently logged in user. This can be implemented however you see fit. This example simply logs the author parameter to the console.

```
/** 
* View profile function 
* @param user - User or userId whose profile should be displayed 
*/ 
authDelegate.viewProfile = function(user) { 
   console.log(author); 
};
```

## Step 4: Sync to Livefyre with Ping for Pull for Janrain Integration {#section_ilv_bzt_bbb}

Keeping Livefyre Remote Profiles in sync with your Capture user management system involves a series of steps referred to as Ping for Pull. This process requires that you obtain a valid access token from Janrain, and then pass that token to an endpoint specified in step 3, below.

1. Get an access code from Janrain.

   To get the access code, supply the necessary credentials, specify the user_type as “user”, and the uuid as the current user’s uuid to update. For more information, see [https://developers.janrain.com/rest-api/methods/authentication/access-codes-and-tokens/getauthorizationcode/](https://developers.janrain.com/rest-api/methods/authentication/access-codes-and-tokens/getauthorizationcode/).

1. Trade the access code for an access token. Supply the necessary credentials, the access code received from step 1, and specify the grant_type as “authorization_code”.

   For more information, see [https://developers.janrain.com/rest-api/methods/authentication/oauth/token/](https://developers.janrain.com/rest-api/methods/authentication/oauth/token/).

1. Hit the Livefyre “Ping to Pull Capture” endpoint.

   Endpoint URL: [!DNL https://{networkName}/api/v1.1/private/capture/profile_updated/?jrtoken={token}] where ***{networkName}*** is the network name provided to you by Livefyre, and the jrtoken is the token received from Janrain in step 2.

   Once you hit this endpoint, you receive a 202 response and Livefyre begins an async process.

## How It All Works {#concept_mty_f31_2cb}

To benefit from this built-in Capture/Backplane integration, you must make some configuration changes to both your Capture app and your Livefyre.js integration.

Janrain sends successful login/logout messages through the Backplane bus, on which the Livefyre App, when properly configured, listens. These messages contain all the information needed to show App users as logged in or logged out. Developers can view Backplane bus messages by inspecting the Network tab in your browser’s developer console.

        } 
      } 
    } 
  } 
} 
]);
```

Empty Response:

```
Backplane.response([]);
```

## Logout Code Example {#section_t52_svp_mz}

Request:

```
https://backplane1.janrainbackplane.com/v1.2/bus/{CUSTOMER}/channel/new?callback=Backplane.finishInit&amp;rnd=0.1057701709214598
```

Response:

```
Backplane.finishInit("{CHANNEL}");
```

If these messages are not appearing in your network requests, Livefyre will not be aware of the login/logout attempts and therefore, Livefyre won’t be able to integrate the user into the App.
