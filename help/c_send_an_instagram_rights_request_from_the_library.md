# Send a Partially-Automated Instagram Rights Request

Before you can send a partially-automated rights request you must:

* Add an Instagram business account. For more information on how to configure an Instagram business account, see [](t_configure_social_accout_instagram/c_about_instagram_accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts).
* Set up Rights Management. For more information on how to set up rights management, see [](c_how_requesting_rights_works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).
If you have not configured an *Instagram business account* you can manually send rights requests for assets from Instagram. See [](c_send_instagram_manual_rights_request.md#c_send_instagram_manual_rights_request) for how to send a manual Instagram rights request. Configure an *Instagram business account* to use a partially-automated workflow. For more information about Instagram accounts, see [](t_configure_social_accout_instagram/c_about_instagram_accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts)

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL  Rights options]** window.
1. Select the account to use to request rights. The account must be an Instagram business account.
1. (Optional) Edit the request message. If the message is missing an element or a required element is misspelled, an error message displays that specifies the incorrect or missing information.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Copy]** to copy the text in the box to your clipboard. ![](assets/rr_insta_workaround1.png)

   Livefyre automatically copies the text from the box to the clipboard and displays a message confirming that you have copied the text.

1. Click on the link in the confirmation message to open the post that contains the asset to which you are requesting rights. ![](assets/rr_insta_workaround2.png)

   Livefyre opens the post in Instagram.

1. Paste the copied rights request text into the Instagram post on Instagram.
1. To find out if the user responded, you must manually monitor the post in Instagram for the response.
1. If the Instagram user grants rights, you can manually grant the rights to the piece of content in Livefyre. For information on how to manually grant rights in Livefyre, see [](t_manually_grant_the_rights_for_one_or_more_assets.md#t_manually_grant_the_rights_for_one_or_more_assets).
