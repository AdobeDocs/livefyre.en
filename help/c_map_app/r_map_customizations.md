# Map Customizations

Change the size, width, and interaction options of the Map app.

<a id="section_kff_cbg_sy"></a>

The following options are available from the Map app:

* **[!UICONTROL Cluster number]**

  Sets the color for the numbers listed above each content cluster in the App.

* **[!UICONTROL Show zoom controls]**

  Allows users to control the zoom level of your Map.

* **[!UICONTROL Allow panning]**

  Enables panning for your Map, allowing users to drag and reposition the map.

* **[!UICONTROL Enable content modal]**

  Allows users to click on a piece of content to open it in a popup window.

* **[!UICONTROL Enable clustering]**

  Creates clickable groups of content, scaled to user zoom.

* **[!UICONTROL Embedded height / Embedded width]**

  Allows you to set the pixel size at which the Map will be embedded on your site. (Optional.)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If your web developers have defined a **[!UICONTROL height]** for your Map on the page, these values will be overridden, and your Map will follow responsive design sizing conventions. If they have not defined a height, these values will be used, and your Map will be placed at a set size (non-responsive design). If these fields are left blank, the value will default to 600px wide by 400px high, and the Map will not be responsive.

* **[!UICONTROL Location]**

  Enter the location around which you wish your map to be centered. Use the slider beneath the preview map to define the zoom.

You can customize the Map app using:

* **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**.

* Integration tools. See Map for more on how to customize Apps using Integration Tools.
