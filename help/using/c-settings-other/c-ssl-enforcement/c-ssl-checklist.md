# SSL Checklist{#ssl-checklist}

Follow the steps in the checklist to ensure you will successfully convert from HTTP to HTTPS.

You will successfully convert from HTTP to HTTPS if the following items are completed:

* All of my server-to-server integrations use HTTPS.
* All of my server-to-server integrations support the TLS 1.2 cipher.
* All of my mobile apps use HTTPS.
* All of my mobile apps support the TLS 1.2 cipher.
* All of my custom JavaScript integrations (StreamhubSDK or direct API usage) use HTTPS.
* If I bundle Livefyre JavaScript, we are using the latest versions.
* I have notified any third-party service (e.g. content analytics, moderation, etc.) which consumes Livefyre APIs on my behalf of these changes.
