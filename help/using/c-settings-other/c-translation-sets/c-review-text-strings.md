## Implementation {#section-vsy-1k4-xz}

To implement this feature, pass in a 1-1 object mapping of the strings you wish to override to the Javascript configuration object. If you don’t provide a field, the default text will be used.

Example:

```
var customStrings = { 
   postAsButton: "New Post As Text", 
   postEditButton: "New Post Edit Text" }; 
networkConfig["strings"] = customStrings; fyre.conv.load( 
   networkConfig, 
   [convConfig], 
   function(){} 
);
```
