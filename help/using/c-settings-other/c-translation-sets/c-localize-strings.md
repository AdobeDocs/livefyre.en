# Localize Strings{#localize-strings}

Customizing the strings of the Livefyre Apps.

The text strings for most HTML elements in any Livefyre App may be customized. This provides the flexibility to change the text of rendered HTML elements, such as the “Post As” button, the “Comment Count” text, or the “Sign In” button, to any valid UTF-8 string. Use this feature to add personality to your implementation of the stream, or to localize the language in the app for your user base.

## Implementation {#section_im4_224_xz}

To implement this feature, pass in a 1-1 object mapping of the strings you wish to override to the JavaScript configuration object. If you don’t provide a field, then the default text will be used.

Example:

```
var customStrings = {     
   postAsButton: "New Post As Text",     
   postEditButton: "New Post Edit Text"  
};   
   convConfig["strings"] = customStrings; fyre.conv.load(     
   networkConfig,     
   [convConfig],     
   function(){}  
);
```

This page lists all text strings which may be customized for the Livefyre Core Apps.
