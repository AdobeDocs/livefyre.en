Announcements for Livefyre and Livefyre Studio. Current as of June 5, 2019.

## June 5, 2019

While Facebook generally provides advanced notice of changes whenever possible, they made a swift decision yesterday to disable access to Facebook and Instagram content within Livefyre. Due to this change, you will not be able to stream, search, or share Facebook or Instagram content.  We sincerely apologize for not being able to provide you with a heads up on this change.
 
Please keep in mind that there are still ways to access Facebook and Instagram content at this time:
 
* Content that is already published on your website(s) will not be impacted  
* Content that is already in your streams folder is still available for use
 
We are working closely with Facebook to reinstate this functionality and we hope for a resolution soon. Thank you and please let me know if I can answer any questions. We want to extend our ongoing appreciation for your patience and partnership.
 


## November 15, 2018 {#section_yx3_hnp_5fb}

Two additional features that address the Instagram API deprecations from early May are now live:

* **Search and stream content from business accounts**

  The API deprecations removed the ability to search personal Instagram accounts. As an alternative, the Livefyre team has released functionality that will enable you to search and stream content from business accounts, including your own.

* **Automatic monitoring of usage rights request responses for business account-based searches**

  Facebook also removed the ability for partners like Adobe to send rights request messages from Instagram on behalf of their customers, eliminating the ability to do fully automated rights management from Livefyre. In May, we delivered manual, cut and paste functionality to give customers the ability to resume tracking usage rights approvals and maintaining records for auditing. As of today—for business accounts-based searches only--the ability to automatically monitor responses to rights requests and update the activity history in Livefyre is available.

## June 22, 2018 {#section_k1t_vmv_g2b}

We are happy to announce that the ability to search for video content in Instagram has been reinstated.

## June 14, 2018 {#section_kk5_qpz_d2b}

Please read the latest updates on the status of functionality related to the Instagram API deprecations:

* **Search and stream content from business accounts**

  As announced in early May, the API deprecations removed the ability to search personal Instagram accounts. As an alternative, the Livefyre team has built functionality that enables you to search and stream content from business accounts. While the Livefyre team has completed this work, its release is pending approval by Facebook. As such, we anticipate this functionality being available later this summer and will notify you as soon as it is live.

* **Usage rights request workflow**

  On May 24, we delivered a manual solution in the usage rights request workflow for Instagram content. We continue to work on restoring the functionality that automatically monitors the response to your rights request and updates the activity history. We anticipate this functionality being available later this summer and will notify you as soon as it is live.

## May 24, 2018 {#section_xbk_wvd_ydb}

Part one of two updates to the usage rights request workflow for Instagram content is now available. From App Content and the Library, you are now able to copy the request rights message from Livefyre Studio and paste it to the exact Instagram post you are seeking approval to use. The ability to do this in ModQ will be delivered in a future release. By June 14, 2018, we will restore the functionality that automatically monitors the response to your rights request and updates the activity history.

Please read the [May 24, 2018, release notes](/help/using/c-rn/previous-rns/rn2018/c-rn-2018-may-24.md#c_rn) for more information and instructions on how to use this capability.

## May 17, 2018 {#section_hwb_1qz_wdb}

We’re happy to inform you that the ability to execute the following Instagram capabilities in Livefyre are once again available:

* Publish and save Instagram content to folders and apps in Social Search
* View details of each piece of content
* Carry out moderation actions on new Instagram content in ModQ

## May 7, 2018 {#section_dms_ypz_wdb}

To all Livefyre customers,

On Thursday, May 3, 2018, Facebook deprecated a number of Instagram APIs used by 3rd party partners to access different aspects of Instagram content in order to protect personal privacy and the data of their users.

We appreciate your patience as we analyzed the impact on the Livefyre system. The following overview clarifies which Livefyre capabilities continue to work seamlessly and which capabilities the API deprecation has impacted, and how and when we’ll address the changes.

First, rest assured that the majority of Livefyre’s Instagram capabilities remain unaffected. Instagram content can still be streamed by hashtag and location, and will publish to folders and Livefyre visualization apps. Streaming content for all other sources—Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, RSS and email--remain unchanged.

After a full system analysis, here are the capabilities impacted by the API deprecation and dates by which we anticipate they will be addressed.

**The following functions are currently unavailable and are expected to be made available by May 17, 2018:**

* View detail, save and publish Instagram content to folders and apps in Social Search.
* Take action on Instagram content in ModQ.

**Work-arounds for the following functionality are expected to be made available by the dates shown below:**

* **Usage rights request workflow—May 24, 2018**

  Livefyre can no longer send messages on behalf of a user account. Requesting usage rights for Instagram content must now be done manually. Livefyre will provide a simple cut and paste workflow to help customers track approvals and maintain audit records.

* **User search and streams workflow—June 14, 2018**

  While you can still search by hashtag and keyword, the ability to search personal Instagram accounts has been eliminated. As an alternative, Livefyre will build functionality that enables you to search and stream content from business accounts. If you use Livefyre to search and stream your own organization’s Instagram content, be sure to [upgrade](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522?helpref=search&sr=2&query=change%20personal%20account%20to%20business%20account) to a business account to take advantage of this functionality.

**We are continuing to evaluate solutions for the following functionality that we are unable to replace in the short term:** 

* **Search by URL**. The ability to search by URL to locate a specific piece of media is no longer available.
* **Video content**. Video content will no longer be surfaced through Instagram search.

We sincerely apologize for any disruption that this causes and will continue to inform you of our progress as we address these changes.

The Adobe Livefyre team
