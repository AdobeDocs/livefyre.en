# Streams{#streams}

Pipe selected content to your Livefyre Apps or Studio Library.

Streams allow you to create rules to pull content from social media websites and push that content to your Asset Library or a selected Livefyre App.

(Rule options vary by source type.)

Streams defined with Folder destinations will save content as assets to your Asset Library.

Multiple streams may be pushed to a single destination (folder or App).

Streams defined with App destinations will push content directly to your App, and will be available from the Published tab in your Library.

Use the Streams interface to define rules by which Studio will pipe selected content to your Livefyre Apps or Asset Library.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Content created while your Stream is active will appear in your Apps. Content created before rules are defined and the Stream is active, or after a Stream has been disabled, will not display in your Apps.
