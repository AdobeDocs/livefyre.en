# Add a Social Account{#add-a-social-account}

Configure a social account to request rights or search for UGC in streams or social searches.

Livefyre uses Twitter and Instagram social accounts to enable you to perform a social search (in the Library) or to use Streams.

You must configure an account in Twitter in order to use the Twitter social search in the Library.

Instagram has different rules for social accounts, depending on how you use Adobe Livefyre. For information on what type of social accounts you can use with Livefyre, see [About Instagram Accounts](/help/using/c-users-creating-accounts-with-studio-access/t-configure-social-accout-instagram/c-about-instagram-accounts.md#c_about_instagram_accounts).

To configure a social account:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Settings >]** **[!UICONTROL Network Settings.]**
1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Social Accounts]** section under **[!UICONTROL Network Settings]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Account]** under the type of social account you are adding. A dialog box pops up to allow you to authorize the account for Livefyre.
