# Users: Creating User Accounts{#users-creating-user-accounts}

Studio Accounts allow you to access all Studio components for which you have permissions, including App creation, Content moderation, and User management.

Studio Users with access to multiple networks will be able to manage these networks from a single account.

Studio accounts enable access to Livefyre Studio and differ from user accounts used to interact with Livefyre Apps.
