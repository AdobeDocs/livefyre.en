Release Notes for the February 9, 2017 release.

## SocialSync for Twitter {#section_nv4_yry_wy}

SocialSync for Twitter has been a part of our core functionality for several years. However, as our product has developed and grown over time, SocialSync for Twitter has become a lower-value feature that is currently used by a very small portion of our customer base. To improve the overall experience of Livefyre for our customers and focus development resources in areas of greatest value, we will be discontinuing the SocialSync for Twitter feature on February 24. SocialSync for Facebook will be unaffected by this update. If you have any questions or concerns about this update, please reach out to your Livefyre CSM.
