  * Request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow.

  * For information on what type of Instagram accounts you need to set up and requesting rights from Instagram, see [About Instagram Accounts](/help/using/c-users-creating-accounts-with-studio-access/t-configure-social-accout-instagram/c-about-instagram-accounts.md).

* **Automatic monitoring of usage rights request responses for business account-based searches.** For business accounts-based searches only--the ability to automatically monitor responses to rights requests and update the activity history in Livefyre is available.
