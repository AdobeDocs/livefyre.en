Release Notes for the May 17, 2018 release.

## Known Issues {#section_syx_mdt_wcb}

**Instagram Rights Requests.** Due to an Instagram API change, you currently cannot send rights requests to and from Instagram from Livefyre. To send a rights request, you must copy and paste the request into Instagram, then manually grant rights in Livefyre after an Instagram user grants rights to the content. A more seamless workaround will be introduced by May 24, 2018. [More information here](/help/using/c-anouncements.md#c_anouncements).
