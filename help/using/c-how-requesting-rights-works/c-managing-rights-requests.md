# Managing Rights Requests{#managing-rights-requests}

You can manage Rights Requests in the following ways:

* Request Rights from the Library, App Content, or ModQ for Twitter content. For more information on how to send a rights request for Twitter content, see [Send a Twitter Rights Request](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/t-send-a-rights-request-to-own-a-digital-asset.md#t_send_a_rights_request_to_own_a_digital_asset).
* Request Rights from the Library or App content for Instagram content. For more information on how to send a rights request for Instagram content, see [Send Instagram Rights Requests Manually](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/c-send-instagram-manual-rights-request.md#c_send_instagram_manual_rights_request) and [Send a Partially-Automated Instagram Rights Request](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/c-send-an-instagram-rights-request-from-the-library.md#c_send_an_instagram_rights_request_from_the_library).

* Request Rights from AEM Assets. For more information on how to request rights from AEM Commerce. To learn more about requesting rights for content from AEM Assets, see [Use Livefyre with AEM Assets](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/livefyre.html#UseLivefyrewithAEMAssets).
* View the rights request history for a piece of content. For more information on how to view the history of rights requests for a piece of content, see [View Rights Activity History](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/c-view-rights-activity-history.md#c_view_rights_activity_history).
* Search for content with a specific rights status in the Library or App Content to follow-up on previous rights requests. For more on how to manage content with previous rights requests, see [Manage Content with a Pending Rights Request](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/t-manage-content-with-pending-rights-request.md#t_manage_content_with_pending_rights_request). 
* Manually override the rights for one or more assets at a time. For more on how to manually grant rights, see [Manually Grant or Revoke Rights](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/t-manually-grant-the-rights-for-one-or-more-assets.md#t_manually_grant_the_rights_for_one_or_more_assets).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Overriding a rights request is stating that you own the content. Do not override a rights request without verifying that you own the content.
