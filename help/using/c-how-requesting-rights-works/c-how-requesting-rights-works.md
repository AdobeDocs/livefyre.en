# Requesting Rights{#requesting-rights}

Learn how rights requests work. When you bring user-generated content (UGC) into a Livefyre App, the content includes tacit permission for reuse. You must have the author's permission to use content from Twitter or Instagram.

The following rights statuses are available from the Library, App Content, ModQ, and AEM Commerce:

* **[!UICONTROL Granted]**. When the author grants you the right to reuse their content, the status of the asset changes to **[!UICONTROL Granted]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Expired]**. Livefyre monitors the Instagram and Twitter stream for the authorâ€™s reply for 14 days. After 14 days, the request expires, the rights request status changes to **[!UICONTROL Expired]**, and you can send a second request or remove the item from your Library.
* **[!UICONTROL Requested]**. Request permission for content from the Library. You can do this for one or more assets at a time. After you request permission, Livefyre sets the asset status to **[!UICONTROL Requested]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Needs Review]**. If the author replies with a note that does not include your #approvalHashtag, the status of the asset changes to **[!UICONTROL Needs Review]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Request Failed]**. Request failed to be sent (due to expired token, etc.). 
* **[!UICONTROL Request Pending]**. Queues the Rights Request so that not too many are sent at one time.

You can request rights for assets you obtained from Twitter and Instagram. You must save the asset to the Library to request rights.

You must configure an *Instagram business account* to request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow.

You can only use this functionality for content you obtained from a search or stream searching by a business account. To request rights for content you obtained from a personal Instagram account, you must send rights requests manually.
