# Adobe Launch Livefyre Extension {#lf-launch-extension}

Learn to configure the Adobe Livefyre Extension for Adobe Launch.

Launch is the next generation of website tag and mobile SDK management capabilities from Adobe. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising integrations necessary to power relevant customer experiences.

Launch empowers anyone to build and maintain their own integrations with Launch, called Extensions. These extensions are available to web and mobile Launch customers in an app-store experience, so customers can quickly install, configure, and deploy their integrations. To learn how to implement and configure the Livefyre Extension, see [Adobe Launch documentation for the Livefyre Extension](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/web/adobe-livefyre-extension).
