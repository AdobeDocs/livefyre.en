# Manage Asset Folders{#manage-asset-folders}

Studio offers several options by which you may manage your folders.

The following options are available to manage folders and assets:

* **[!UICONTROL Favorite:]** Click the star icon next to a folderâ€™s name at the top of the page to tag the folder, and add it to your **[!UICONTROL Favorites]** list.

* **[!UICONTROL Upload Asset:]** Opens a Filepicker window, from which you may search for and upload content from your desktop, Flickr, URLs, or other locations, to add to your Asset Library.
* **[!UICONTROL Create New Subfolder:]** Allows you to create a subfolder within the currently selected folder. Subfolders inherit the Access rights of their parent folder, and their Access cannot be individually managed.
* **[!UICONTROL Trash Folder:]** Removes the folder and its content from your Asset Library.
