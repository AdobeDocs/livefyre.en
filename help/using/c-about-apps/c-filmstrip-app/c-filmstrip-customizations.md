# Filmstrip Customizations{#filmstrip-customizations}

All Apps use **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer.]**

You can customize Filmstrip using the following additional options in the App Designer:

* **[!UICONTROL Content fit]**. Choose **[!UICONTROL crop]** to crop the content to fill the card or **[!UICONTROL Aspect Ratio]** to display an entire image in the card, whether it fills up the entire card or not.
* **[!UICONTROL Tile Size]**. Enter the size of the tiles in pixels. 
* **[!UICONTROL Show Notifications]**. Choose whether to display a notification for new content as it streams into the Filmstrip App.
* **[!UICONTROL Require rights]**. Enable this option to display only content with a rights request status of "Granted."
* **[!UICONTROL Hide social branding when rights granted]** Switch this on to remove the logo for the originating social media network (Twitter or Instagram) when rights are granted for a piece of content. 
* **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** You can use the call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.

  * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** Switch the toggle to on to display the call-to-action button.
  * **[!UICONTROL Require rights to display products]** Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a call-to-action button appears for the content.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.

  * **[!UICONTROL Show call-to-action in tile]**. Choose whether to display the call-to-action button on a Filmstrip tile instead of displaying the call-to-action button only when the site visitor clicks on a card and opens the content in a larger window.
  * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action indication text]** The text to display to prompt the user to click on the card to open the call-to-action modal.
  * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action header text]** The words to display in the header above the call-to-action button in the content modal. Default text is, "Shop these products:".
  * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button text]** The words to display in the call-to-action button in the content modal. Default text is, "Buy Now:".
  * **[!UICONTROL Product display options]** Choose whether you want to display the **[!UICONTROL Photo]** and the **[!UICONTROL Product name]** with the call-to-action button.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Both the Photo and Product name buttons highlight blue when they are enabled.

  * **[!UICONTROL Product URL referral tracking]** Switch the toggle to on to track referrals from this App to the associated product page. 
  * **[!UICONTROL Referral tracking key-value pairs]** Add parameters to further specify the referral tracking from your App content to the associated product page.

* **[!UICONTROL Embed App in multiple pages]**.

  * **[!UICONTROL Filter UGC by Product ID]**. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App.
  * **[!UICONTROL Select product folders]**. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages.
  * **[!UICONTROL Show related content]**. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
