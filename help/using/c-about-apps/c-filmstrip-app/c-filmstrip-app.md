Filmstrip is a visualization App that showcases user-generated content into a dynamic single, horizontal strip of photos, similar to a strip of film from a camera.

## About Filmstrip {#section_tng_slj_yy}

You can use Filmstrip with UGC in e-commerce scenarios, such as product pages or transactional websites. End users can navigate Filmstrip by clicking the side arrows to scroll through the available content from left to right. New content displays on the left as it comes into the App. You can choose whether newly streamed UGC will have a label on it that says, *New* to help site visitors quickly identify new content.

You can choose whether site visitors can view a call-to-action button on a card and hover over the button to see a preview of products for sale. You can choose to associate products from your product catalog with content in the Filmstrip. Mobile and non-mobile site visitors can click on a card to view a larger image, share content, play video, or view associated products and a call-to-action button to purchase the items.

## How does a site visitor see content in a Filmstrip? {#section_w5c_plj_yy}

A site visitor sees content populated into a Filmstrip from Studio from a Studio Stream, Library, or Social Search. If new content is published to the App while a site visitor is on the page, the new content displays on the left and pushes the old content to the right in real time without a site visitor having to refresh their page. If you choose to notify the site visitor of new content, then the site visitor sees a notification that says "new" and an arrow pointing towards the left to indicate that they need to scroll left to see new content.

## What happens when a site visitor clicks on an item in a Filmstrip? {#section_cvz_nlj_yy}

On a computer or a mobile device, click on a card to share content, view a larger image, watch a video, see multiple media items, or view associated products tagged in the UGC.

On a computer, hover over the call-to-action button to see products associated with the content.

## Can a site visitor share content from a Filmstrip? {#section_zzz_mlj_yy}

Yes. A site visitor can share all content types on a Filmstrip. On a computer or mobile device, click on a card to open it and click the share icon.

## How does new content get added to a Filmstrip? {#section_f4w_klj_yy}

Add content to a Filmstrip by:

* Publishing manually from the Library, App Content, or ModQ. 
* Setting up a stream to publish automatically.

New content automatically streams into the Filmstrip App on the left and pushes the old content to the right in real time without a site visitor having to refresh their page. If you choose to notify the site visitor of new content, then the site visitor sees a notification that says "new" and an arrow pointing towards the left to indicate that if they want to see new content they need to scroll left to see new content.

## How does text-only content show in the app? {#section_h31_klj_yy}

Filmstrip does not display text-only content. Filmstrip displays only images and videos.

## Why does some of my content not show up on my site even though the content displays in Studio? {#section_upr_hlj_yy}

Filmstrip displays content in a horizontal strip of five by default. The number of tiles depends on the size of the container in which the App displays and the tile size you choose in the App Designer. Livefyre recommends you add at least five to ten pieces of content in your Filmstrip App to provide an adequate number of tiles with content and allow users to scroll through to find more.

Sometimes content doesn't display because you turned on **[!UICONTROL Require rights]**. If you turn this on, you are required to have rights granted for all content in the App. If the rights status is not "granted" for a piece of content, it will not display in the App.

## How does a site visitor know when a new product is added? {#section_ttt_xps_mbb}

You can choose to add notifications of new content as it is added by switching **[!UICONTROL Show Notifications]** to **[!UICONTROL On]**.
