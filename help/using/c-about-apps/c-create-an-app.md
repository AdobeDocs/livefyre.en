# Create an App {#create-an-app}

To add an App to your site, you must first create an App in Livefyre Studio.

To create a new App:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL +New App]** from the Apps page, and select an App type from the pulldown menu.
1. The **[!UICONTROL New App]** dialog box appears. Enter an **[!UICONTROL App Title]**, select a **[!UICONTROL Site]**, and click **[!UICONTROL Create]** to open the App Overview page.

The App Summary page provides 4 tabs:

* **[!UICONTROL App Summary]**: provides an overview of the App’s content and status, and provides tools to access the App on its site and generate its embed code.
* **[!UICONTROL Designer]**: allows you to select design options for the App, including fonts, color schemes, and App specific configuration options.
* **[!UICONTROL Streams]**: lists all Stream sources for the App’s content. Click the Stream’s title to open the Stream Details page, from which it may be edited.
* **[!UICONTROL Settings]**: allows you to select App specific settings, including rules for adding content to the App, and the types of content to display. Click the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab to override the Network and Site Settings for the App.

## Apps List {#section_eyp_ykt_bbb}

The Apps list page provides access to all of your existing Livefyre Apps.

The Apps list page displays the following information:

* **[!UICONTROL Title]**: Lists your App’s title, and includes an icon indicating the App type.
* **[!UICONTROL Site]**: Lists the App’s location, by site.
* **[!UICONTROL Content Count]**: Lists the number of pieces of content published to the App.
* **[!UICONTROL Date Modified]**: Lists the last time the App was changed in App Designer.
* **[!UICONTROL Embed Code (</>)]**: Click the icon to generate the embed code for your App.

## App Customization {#section_lvj_xlt_bbb}

You can use the App Designer tab to select **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** options to customize your Apps.

**[!UICONTROL Style]** Options are consistent across all App types; **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** Options vary by App. The bottom of the **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** pane lists the Livefyre App version for your App.

**Select Style Options**

Style Apps to fit your site’s branding. Use the **[!UICONTROL Style]** options to select the App’s color and font styles.

* **[!UICONTROL Theme]**. Select **[!UICONTROL Light]** or **[!UICONTROL Dark]** to define the background color for your displayed content. Changes made to this setting will be immediately reflected in the preview to the right. This setting controls background, content text, user handle, timestamp, share button, and social icon color selection for the App.

* **[!UICONTROL Brand color]**. Select a color for your App. This color will be used for hashtags, URLs, usernames, @mentions, bar charts, and other App-specific components, as displayed in the preview pane to the right.
* **[!UICONTROL Font family]**. Select a font for user generated content in your App. Selecting Georgia or Times New Roman will assign that font to content, and Helvetica Neue to usernames and display names. Selecting Helvetica, Verdana, or Trebuchet will assign those fonts to content, usernames, and display names.
* **[!UICONTROL Font size]**. Select a default font size. This setting will affect all user generated content and titles displayed in the App.

## Updating Apps {#section_iwb_4bz_vcb}

If a newer version of the App exists, an **[!UICONTROL Update]** button displays.

Click the button to update to the newest release version. Refresh your App to use all available feature enhancements and bug fixes. Once updated, preview changes made to your App (if any), then accept or reject the update.

## Add a Call-to-action Button to an App {#section_cpf_cmt_bbb}

Add a Call-to-action button to drive conversion from UGC.

To add a Call-to-action button to an App:

1. Create a Mosaic or Media Wall App.

   For information on the customizations available in a Mosaic or Media wall, see [Mosaic Customizations](/help/using/c-about-apps/c-mosaic-app/c-mosaic-customizations.md) or [Media Wall Customizations](../c-about-apps/c-media-wall-app/r-media-wall-customizations.md#r_media_wall_customizations).

## App Previews {#section_eyy_4mt_bbb}

App Designer allows you to preview your App in multiple delivery formats, and with your own or sample data displayed.

Select **[!UICONTROL Exit Preview]** to return to design mode.

Preview Mode offers the following options:

* **[!UICONTROL Preview Options]**: Use the pulldown menu to select a preview format (mobile, tablet, or desktop) and whether to show **[!UICONTROL Sample Data]** or the App’s Stream data.

* 

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If you deselect **[!UICONTROL Sample Data]**, and no Stream is enabled for the App, no content displays in Preview Mode.

* **[!UICONTROL Share]**: Opens the App in a new browser tab, and generates a URL, which may be used to allow friends, colleagues, or non-Studio users to review your App, and test it in different browsers and devices.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Any content posted to a review version of your App will be added to the App. If you do not wish this content to appear in your published App, you must delete it before clicking **Publish**.

* **[!UICONTROL Exit Preview]**: Returns you to edit mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview mode is fully interactive, allowing you to test the user experience for your App. If you enable **[!UICONTROL Allow user posts]**, users with the preview link can click the **[!UICONTROL What’s on your mind]** button and post content to your test version. Studio lists content as posted.

## App Publishing {#section_df1_smt_bbb}

App Designer automatically saves your App after you make a change. You can use **[!UICONTROL Publish]** to generate an embed code, or to update any previously published versions of this App with the current version.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Clicking **[!UICONTROL Publish]** generates an embed code for the App, and updates all existing instances of the App if previously published.

## Review App History {#section_jsk_vmt_bbb}

App Designer automatically saves your App after you make a change and generates a new version for each change. You can use **[!UICONTROL History]** to open a panel listing all versions of your App. Listed versions will show each version’s editor and its age.

To review App history:

1. Click on a version to select it.
1. Refresh the preview display.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Restore Version]** to clone the selected version and work from it.
1. Click the back button in **[!UICONTROL Version History]** to revert to your working draft.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can not edit an App while the **[!UICONTROL Version History]** pane is open.

If another editor makes changes while your browser window is open, Livefyre issues a warning message when you try to edit the App, asking if you wish to return to your (older) draft version. (This prevents multiple simultaneous editors from accidentally ignoring each other’s changes.) Click **[!UICONTROL Update to Latest]** to begin working from the latest version. Click **[!UICONTROL Overwrite]** to return to your (older) working state, increment the version number from the most recent, and continue working.

## App Summary Tab {#section_rxx_xmt_bbb}

Use the App Summary tab to manage information for individual Apps.

The App Summary tab allows you to:

* **[!UICONTROL See on Site]**: Opens the App on your site.
* **[!UICONTROL Embed code]**: Available only for published Apps, provides a clickable link to generate the embed code for any published App.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Use this embed code to add Polls to your Comments or Live Blog App. For more information, see Custom Interactions > Custom HTML.

* **[!UICONTROL Moderate]**: Opens ModQ, listing all content awaiting moderation for the App.

## Embed an App on your Site Using Studio {#section_w3h_1nt_bbb}
