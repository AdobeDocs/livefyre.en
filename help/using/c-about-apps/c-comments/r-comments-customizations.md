# Comments Customizations{#comments-customizations}

Customize comments to embed real-time conversations on your site.



Use available options to allow your users to share content across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and pull their friends into the stream.

* **[!UICONTROL Number of comments to load]**

  Enter the number of comments to display upon initial load. You may enter between 1 and 50.

* **[!UICONTROL Nest level for replies]**

  Defines the number of nested levels displayed for replies: 2, 3 or 4. (Default is 4.)

* **[!UICONTROL Posts appear in cards]**

  If enabled, posts will be displayed within a surrounding box, and the background color dictated by the **[!UICONTROL Theme]** selection applied.

* **[!UICONTROL Expand media]**

  If enabled, media attachments will be displayed as fully expanded media inline in the stream. If disabled, media is displayed as links only.

* **[!UICONTROL Number of listeners]**

  If enabled, the number of users active on the page will be displayed.

* **[!UICONTROL User tags]**

  If enabled, user tags will be displayed with posted content.

* **[!UICONTROL User avatars]**

  If enabled, user avatars will be displayed with posted content.

* **[!UICONTROL Number of replies to load]**

  The number of replies to a comment to load. Any additional replies to a comment after this number will be collapsed, with a counter to display the number of replies.

* **[!UICONTROL Users may upload photos]**

  If enabled users may upload photos.

* **[!UICONTROL Users may share posts]**

  If enabled users may share posts. If enabled, users may share posted content to Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. For more information on enabling sharing, see Settings > Integration Settings > Social Sharing.

* **[!UICONTROL Featured content at top of stream]**

  When enabled, Featured content will be displayed above the editor in the App.

* **[!UICONTROL High velocity comment queuing]**

  Allows you to control the speed with which comments are displayed on the page, and is best used for high velocity conversations. When enabled, Livefyre will list the number of new comments at the top of the stream, rather than displaying content in its entirety. Clicking this number will display the 10 oldest comments in the stream.

* **[!UICONTROL Most liked comment sort]**

  If enabled, allows users to sort by **[!UICONTROL Top Comments]** or **[!UICONTROL Hot Threads]** (in addition to the default **[!UICONTROL Newest]** and **[!UICONTROL Oldest]** sort options).

You can customize Comments using:

* **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**. See Customizing Apps for details on the standard **[!UICONTROL Style]** and **[!UICONTROL Config]** options for all Apps in the **[!UICONTROL App Designer]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Integration tools]**. See Comments for more on how to customize Comments using Integration Tools.
