# Upload Button{#upload-button}

The Upload Button provides a way for your site visitors to upload content.

You can collect user-generated content directly from your site and display that content in any Livefyre App. Engage your site visitors by encouraging them to contribute to the conversation by uploading content. Livefyre supports image, video, and audio content.
