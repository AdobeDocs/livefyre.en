Allow moderators, owners, and bloggers to add custom HTML attachments to content published through Comments or Live Blog.

This feature may be used to attach any content to your posts, including proprietary video players or polling widgets, in addition to the standard images, video players, and other embeds that are automatically expanded by Livefyre Apps.
