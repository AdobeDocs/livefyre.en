# User Badges{#user-badges}

Use CSS with User Tags to create User Badges for members of your community.

User Badges are custom styling features, which allow you to style Livefyre content posted by specific user types (such as moderators, editors, or any other User Group you wish to define) to Livefyre Chat, Comments, Reviews, or Live Blog Apps. This allows you to highlight this content to your users.

Apps that use this feature:

* [Chat](../../c-about-apps/c-chat-app/c-chat-app.md#c_chat_app)
* [Comments](/help/using/c-about-apps/c-comments/c-comments.md)
* [Reviews](../../c-about-apps/c-reviews-app/c-reviews-app.md#c_reviews_app)
* [Sidenotes](../../c-about-apps/c-sidenotes-app/c-sidenotes-app.md#c_sidenotes_app)
