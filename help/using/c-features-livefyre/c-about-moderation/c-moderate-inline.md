# Moderate Content from a Stream{#moderate-content-from-a-stream}

Moderate content that comes from a Stream using the Library.

Moderators can approve or reject pending comments directly from the stream, using the Library.

To moderate pending content, simply mouse over the **[!UICONTROL Pending]** button.

The **[!UICONTROL Pending]** button changes and you can select whether to Deny ( **[!UICONTROL x]**) or Approve ( **[!UICONTROL ✓]**) the comment.

Mouse over the comment space and the following moderation options display:

* **[!UICONTROL Ban user:]** bans the user from adding content to the site.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This option is site-specific, and will not ban the user from your entire network. For Sidenotes, users may be banned only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.

* **[!UICONTROL Bozo:]** Bozos the content’s author. For Sidenotes, users may be Bozo’d only from within Studio, and not from within the stream.
* **[!UICONTROL Delete:]** Deletes the content from the thread.
* **[!UICONTROL Flag:]** Opens a Flag modal, allowing you to select a flag for the content (Spam, Offensive, Disagree, or Off-Topic), enter an email address to associate with the Flag, if desired, and add a note.
* **[!UICONTROL Share:]** Opens a Share modal, which allows you to share to Facebook or Twitter, edit the text, and include a permalink to the content itself.
* **[!UICONTROL Feature:]** Features the content.
