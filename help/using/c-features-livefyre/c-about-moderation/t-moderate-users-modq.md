# Moderate Users{#moderate-users}

The User Summary pane provides user information to aid moderation.

By default, it displays information for the author of the selected content. Click a flagger’s username to see their information instead.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Streamed content displays only the content’s source, and the author’s username and avatar (if available). User moderation is not available for Stream content authors.

The following information displays (if available) for each of your registered Livefyre users:

* **[!UICONTROL Username]**: their username for your network.
* **[!UICONTROL Display name]**: their display name for your network.
* **[!UICONTROL Avatar]**: their avatar for your network.
* **[!UICONTROL Total number of posts]** by the author across the network: links to a list of Content by that user in Studio. Total is displayed by the number of pieces Approved, Pending, Bozo’d, or Trashed.
* **[!UICONTROL Total #Flags]**: the total number of flags applied to this author’s posts.
* **[!UICONTROL Join date]**: the date they created a user account on your network.
* **[!UICONTROL Email]**: their listed email address.
* **[!UICONTROL IP Address]**: their IP address, as determined by Livefyre.
* **[!UICONTROL Bio]**: description of the user. 
* **[!UICONTROL Bans]**: lists sites for which the user has been banned or Bozo’d.
* **[!UICONTROL Whitelists]**: lists sites for which the user has been whitelisted.
