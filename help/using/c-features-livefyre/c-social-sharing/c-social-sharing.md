Share your content or content from another user, to Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.

Social Sharing allows your community to share their thoughts from your App to their friends on social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and to share other users’ content to Facebook and Twitter. Enabling Social Sharing allows your community to spread the best response to your content, and to bring more traffic to your site.

## Sharing content to social networks {#section_t1q_mz2_wy}

You may configure your network to allow users to share to Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn when posting content to your Livefyre Apps. The default Livefyre **[!UICONTROL Share Modal]** includes links to all three sites. You may customize this modal using the Post To API to override the Livefyre default, and implement your own. For more information, see Advanced Topics > Enabling Social Sharing.

When users click **[!UICONTROL Share]** to post their comment to social networks (Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn), they are prompted to log in through the social app. (The list of available Share options may be customized. By default, Facebook and Twitter share checkboxes are shown on all Apps.) For custom networks, the social apps should be configured to be your social apps. As part of your integration process, add your app credentials through the Integration Settings page in Studio.

>[!NOTE]
>
>LinkedIn is included by default on Livefyre Community Comments. Custom networks must pass in the ‘li’ value when embedding the App to enable the LinkedIn button on the comment toolbar. (For more information, please see Enabling Social Sharing in the developer docs.)

## Sharing other users’ content to social networks {#section_blw_vy2_wy}

Clicking **[!UICONTROL Share]** on another user’s post opens the Share Comment pane, which includes an editable text field, your enabled share options, and a permalink to the post.

By clicking **[!UICONTROL Share]** for a post:

* Users can connect to their social networks by clicking the Twitter or Facebook Icons.
* After authorizing the page to post to the user’s social networks, the Twitter or Facebook buttons will light up to let the user know that they are active.
* Users may personalize the content within the sharing post box.
* Clicking **[!UICONTROL Share]** will send content to the user’s active social networks, with a link that will take others to the exact post that the user wants to share.
* Users may also choose to share a link to a specific comment by pasting the Permalink within an email, blog post, or social network.

>During your integration, you can determine which social networks are available for sharing by your users. You may also integrate a custom Permalink to allow for uniformity with your current media links.
