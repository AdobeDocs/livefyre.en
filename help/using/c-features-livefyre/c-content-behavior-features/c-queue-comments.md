# Queue Comments{#queue-comments}

Stop live streaming and queue content at the top of the stream to control high velocity conversations.

Use Queue Comments to provide a better user experience with high velocity conversations. Designed to encourage thoughtful reading, rather than a real-time experience of posted comments, this feature queues new comments at the top of the stream, and displays a counter of the number of new posts, rather than the posts themselves. Clicking on this number streams the oldest 10 comments into the conversation. Clicking again will stream the next 10. As new replies are posted, they are added to the queue.

The Queue comments feature is available for Comments, and may be set at the network, site or conversation levels, from Studioâ€™s Settings tab.

Apps that use this feature:

* [Chat](../../c-about-apps/c-chat-app/c-chat-app.md#c_chat_app) 
* [Comments](/help/using/c-about-apps/c-comments/c-comments.md)
