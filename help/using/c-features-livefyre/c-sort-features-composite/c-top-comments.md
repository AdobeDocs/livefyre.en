# Top Comments{#top-comments}

Top Comments lists the 25 most liked comments in the conversation. The **[!UICONTROL Top Comments]** view displays the 25 most liked comments in the Collection. If an original post receives the most likes, the post, but not its replies, will be listed. If a reply receives the most likes, its immediate parent, up to the top level post, will also be displayed. This list is not real-time, and will update only when the page is refreshed or another sort view (**[!UICONTROL Newest]** or **[!UICONTROL Oldest]**) is selected.

If a user posts a comment from the comment editor while viewing the **[!UICONTROL Top Comments]** view, the user will be switched back to the **[!UICONTROL Newest]** view. If a user likes or replies to one of the Top Comments, it will stream into the **[!UICONTROL Top Comments]** view for the user to see.

To optimize for performance, Livefyre caches data for up to 2 minutes. There may be a slight lag in the most recent likes that appear.

If there are no comments in the Collection with likes, users will see the message **[!UICONTROL There are not enough likes yet]**, and a link to **[!UICONTROL See whatâ€™s new]**.

>Top Comments and Hot Threads may not be included in the same Collection.

For information on enabling the Top Comments view, please see **[!UICONTROL Studio > Network Settings]**.
