# Delete a Translation Set

Delete a translation set at any time by clicking on the trash can icon next to the translation set you want to delete.

When you delete a translation set that is in use, Studio uses the default translation set for any apps or sites using the deleted translation set.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can delete a translation set that a network, a site, or an app is using. Studio notifies you that the translation set is being used, but still allows you to delete the translation set. Once you delete a translation set it cannot be recovered.

1. Navigate to Settings in Studio. Ensure you are working at the Network level, and not a the Site level.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Network Settings]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Translation Sets]**.
1. Click the trash can icon next to the translation set you want to delete.
1. Confirm that you want to delete the translation set.
