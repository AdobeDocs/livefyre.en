# Assets

Assets are content which has been saved to your Library. Assets are searchable and reusable, and may include added information, including tags and reuse rights.

The Library allows you to organize and manage selected content as Assets for use in all your Livefyre Apps.

The Library also allows you to request the rights to reuse gathered social content, add tags to augment the information stored with Assets, and organize these items in folders, ready to be published to applications.

The Library provides a folder structure view of All Assets, allowing you to search and organize your Assets.
