# Using the Profanity Filter

All content posted into a Livefyre App is checked for profanity. If a word included in the profanity list is found in content or in a user’s display name, that content will be flagged “Profanity,” allowing you to filter it for Premoderation, Rules, ModQ, or general searches in App Content.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Studio Administrators’ and Managers’ content is not subject to the Profanity Rule check, and content posted by a Moderator will not be flagged.

Livefyre provides a default profanity list. You may choose to apply this list at the network level, provide your own list, or use an aggregate of the two. Individual sites within your network may inherit the network Profanity List, or use a list customized to be site-specific.

To provide your own custom profanity list as your network default, please send it to your Livefyre account manager.

## Enabling Profanity Filtering {#section_yqc_qsk_f1b}

Enable and configure the profanity filter at both the network and site level. Disable the profanity filter at the network level to automatically disable the profanity filter for all sites that inherit from the network.

>[!NOTE]
>
>All content passing through Livefyre is checked for profanity. If content is found which includes words contained on the default SAFE profanity list or in your custom Profanity list, it is flagged “Profanity.” To set Livefyre to automatically take action on these items, turn **[!UICONTROL  Enable Profanity Checking]** to **[!UICONTROL  ON]**. 


## Enable the Profanity Filter for a Network {#section_twd_ssk_f1b}


1. Select **[!UICONTROL  Network]** from the network pulldown menu.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL  Settings > Network Settings > Moderation]**.
1. Scroll down to the **[!UICONTROL  Profanity List]**, and set **[!UICONTROL  Enable Profanity Checking]** to **[!UICONTROL  ON]**.
1. Use the **[!UICONTROL  Update Network Profanity List]** field to add words to the list, or click a word to remove it from the list.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Editing the network level Profanity List will not affect any site-level Lists already in place. To ensure that changes from the network are made to the site, select **[!UICONTROL  Restore Network List]** for the site after the changes have been made. 


## Enable the Profanity Filter for a Site {#section_fld_wsk_f1b}


1. Select the site from the network pulldown menu.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL  Settings > Site Settings > Moderation]**.
1. Scroll down to the **[!UICONTROL  Profanity List]** and set **[!UICONTROL  Enable Profanity Checking]** to **[!UICONTROL  ON]**.
1. Choose one of the following options:

    * To inherit the Profanity List from the network (this is not common), set **[!UICONTROL  Use Site Profanity List]** to **[!UICONTROL  OFF]**.
    * To edit the Profanity List specifically for the site, set **[!UICONTROL  Use Site Profanity List]** to **[!UICONTROL  On]** to open the **[!UICONTROL  Update Profanity List]** field, where you can edit the list:     
        * To remove a word, click on the word.
        * To add a word, type the word into the **[!UICONTROL  Add new word]** box and hit **[!UICONTROL  Return]**.
        * To see if a word is included in the list, type the word into the **[!UICONTROL  Test profanity filter]** box.

    * To reimport the network Profanity List and apply it to the site, click **[!UICONTROL  Restore Network List]**.
    * To clear all content from the list and start from scratch, click **[!UICONTROL  Clear List]**.


## Working with Content that Contains Profanity {#section_epy_dtk_f1b}

Use the Profanity List to help filter your content searches and to create Premoderation Rules for ModQ.

To search for content containing profanity, go to **[!UICONTROL  Library > App Content]**, **[!UICONTROL  Filter by Flags]** and check the **[!UICONTROL  Profanity]** checkbox. All content that has been caught by the Profanity Filter for the site or network selected will be displayed. This list will include content pulled into the App using SocialSync and Streams.

To create Premoderation rules, from Studio select **[!UICONTROL  Settings > Network Settings > Moderation]**. Once the profanity filter has been enabled, a new rule will appear, allowing you to Flag or Premoderate content containing profanity. By default, this rule automatically enables **[!UICONTROL  Premoderate]** for profane content, which may be changed to either **[!UICONTROL  Trash it]** or **[!UICONTROL  Bozo it]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a single piece of content is subject to multiple rule types (such as both SAFE and Flag rules), the more stringent will be applied. For example: If your Premoderation rule says to Premoderate a piece of content, but a SAFE Rule says to Trash it, it will be Trashed.


## View and Update the Profanity List for a Network {#section_qdb_btk_f1b}


1. Go to **[!UICONTROL  Settings > Network Settings > Moderation]**.
1. Scroll down to the **[!UICONTROL  Profanity List]** section.
1. Set **[!UICONTROL  Enable Profanity Checking]** to **[!UICONTROL  On]**to display the List enabled for your network (Livefyre default, or your uploaded custom list) and edit it. You can edit the list in the following ways: 
    * To remove a word, click on the word.
    * To add a word, type the word into the **[!UICONTROL  Add new word]** box and hit **[!UICONTROL  Return]**.
    * To see if a word is included in the list, type the word into the **[!UICONTROL  Test profanity filter]** box.
