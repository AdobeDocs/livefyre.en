Media Walls stream live images and other content into a real-time social wall, visualizing all activity surrounding an event.

If enabled, users may post text, images, or video directly to this App. Supported file types include:

* Image: JPEG, GIF, PNG 
* Video: Quicktime/MOV, MP4, MPEG, WebM

* **[!UICONTROL Number of columns.]** Set the number of columns for the Media Wall. The number of columns remains the same, regardless of the size of the window or browser. If you select Auto, the number of columns adjusts to display an optimized number of columns for the screen size. 
* **[!UICONTROL Fit content to width]**. When this option is off, the content is cropped to a square. Toggle this option to on to display an entire image in the card, whether it fills up the entire card or not.

  Allows users to click on a photo in the stream to open it in an overlaid popup window.

        * **[!UICONTROL Comment Modal Button]**. The text of button site visitors click to post content. Default text is "Post Your Comment."

* **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** You can use the Call-to-action button with a product catalog to direct users to a product or to your site for further action.

    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action button]** Switch the toggle to on to display the Call-to-action button. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Require rights to display products]** Switch the toggle to on to require that the content owner has granted rights for the content before a Call-to-action button appears for the content.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The content displays even if rights are not granted for the content, but the Call-to-action button will not display with the content unless rights for the content are granted.

    * **[!UICONTROL Call-to-action header text]** The words to display in the header above the Call-to-action button in the content modal. Default wording is, "Shop these products:".

* **[!UICONTROL Product page filter]**.

    * **[!UICONTROL Filter UGC by Product ID]**. Select this option to create one App for multiple product pages. Filter product-specific UGC to the App for each product page. You can select one or more folders to associate specific collections to the App. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Select Product folders]**. Select the top-level product folders to use to filter UGC. Use CTRL/Command + click to select more than one folder. Livefyre uses the folder to determine which products in that folder to display in the App on various pages. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Show related content]**. Toggle this to display content published to the App, but tagged with a different product ID. After the product-specific content for the App displays, Livefyre displays content for other products and content not associated with a product. Livefyre prioritizes the content with the same product ID first, then content published to the App with other product IDs, then content published to the App with no product IDs.
