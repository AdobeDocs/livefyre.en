# Highlight Content

Highlight select content within your Apps to call out the most relevant posts, and most vetted users.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Customizations are available only for Apps that allow user posts and are configured using a ConvConfig object: for example, Chat, Comments, Live Blog, Reviews, and Sidenotes.

Featuring content allows you to call attention to selected user posts. Featured content may be styled differently than other content on the page, and featured Livefyre-native content appears above the editor.

Styling User Group content allows you to highlight content posted by specific user types such as moderators, editors, or any other User Group you wish to define.
